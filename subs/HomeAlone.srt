1
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,796
- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?

2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,718
I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?

3
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:35,388
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

4
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,558
Hey, hey, little boy.

5
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,977
- Excuse me, girls. Girls.
- Take the witches!

6
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,188
Hey. Hey, big fella.
Excuse me.

7
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:45,598
Come help me make up these
beds in the living room!

8
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:46,633
Excuse me. Ma'am!

9
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,110
- Hi. Hey, son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

10
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,739
Big fella! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

11
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,202
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh, it's crazy.

12
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,579
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

13
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,706
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

14
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,708
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

15
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,752
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?

16
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:10,590
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie, but the big kids can.

17
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,468
- Why can't I?
- Kevin, I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:16,054
When do you come back?
Not till then?

19
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:19,516
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

20
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,852
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

21
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:25,146
then it must be really bad.

22
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,398
No, we're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him...

23
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,943
Hey, hey, hey! Get off.
Kevin, out of the room.

24
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,445
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't ya?

25
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:33,313
Oh, this kid.

26
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,474
Kate, did you by any chance pick
up a voltage adapter thing?

27
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,451
I didn't have time to do that.

28
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:40,453
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

29
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:43,456
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

30
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,458
I've got something
for you to do.

31
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,002
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

32
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,964
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

33
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,071
He was in the garage again
playing with the glue gun.

34
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,158
Didn't we talk about that?

35
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,262
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

36
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,514
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

37
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,391
My new fishhooks?

38
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:06,229
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones,
with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

39
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:10,191
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

40
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,777
Peter, Kate, do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

41
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:16,114
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- Oh, you're getting heavy.

42
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,366
Go pack your suitcase.

43
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,620
Pack my suitcase?

44
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,265
- Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?
- I don't live here.

45
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,750
A house with this many people,
there's no shampoo?

46
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,115
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah, but they don't live here.

47
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,797
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

48
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,176
- Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here?
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

49
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,178
- Hi!
- Hi!

50
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,804
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,848
- Do they live here?
- No.

52
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:46,895
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

53
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,065
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

54
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,443
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

55
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,237
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin, "tough."

56
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:59,073
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

57
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,659
Shake his hand and say,
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

58
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,704
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh, really? You're completely helpless!

59
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,498
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right, Kev.

60
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:11,461
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you.
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

61
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:15,131
- I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.
- Shut up, Linnie.

62
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,133
Do you know what I should pack?

63
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:20,553
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

64
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,556
Listen, Kev, what are
you so worried about?

65
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,434
You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.

66
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,771
You're what the French call
les incompetents.

67
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,858
- What?
- Bombs away!

68
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,908
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

69
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:45,745
If he has something to drink,
he's gonna wet the bed.

70
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,623
This house is so full of people,
it makes me sick!

71
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,751
When I grow up and get married,
I'm livin' alone!

72
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,671
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

73
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,507
I'm livin' alone!

74
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,262
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

75
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:06,766
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

76
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,437
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

77
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,190
Some don't.

78
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,192
But they got nude beaches.

79
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,320
Not in the winter.

80
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:27,745
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

81
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:31,374
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

82
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,459
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

83
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:38,173
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

84
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:43,136
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

85
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,641
Who is he?

86
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:53,104
You ever heard
of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!

87
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,148
- No.
- That's him.

88
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:59,986
Back in '58, he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

89
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:03,448
with a snow shovel.

90
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,868
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

91
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,455
Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

92
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,498
Not enough evidence to convict.

93
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,126
They never found the bodies.

94
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,462
But everyone around here
knows he did it.

95
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:21,299
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

96
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,384
What's he doin' now?

97
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,430
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

98
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,849
salting the sidewalks.

99
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,893
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

100
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,855
No way.

101
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,983
See that garbage can full of salt?

102
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,070
That's where he keeps his victims.

103
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,073
The salt turns the bodies...

104
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,992
into mummies.

105
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:51,037
- Wow.
- Mummies.

106
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,418
Look out!

107
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,995
How you kids doin', huh? Good?

108
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,789
Lot of action
around here today, huh?

109
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,584
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

110
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,005
Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?

111
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:44,174
Where you goin', kid?

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,519
Okay, that's 122.50.

113
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,605
Not for me, kid.
I don't live here.

114
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:02,650
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

115
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,112
- Hey, pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

116
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,865
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

117
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:12,202
Hey, listen, uh...

118
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:15,705
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

119
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:18,124
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

120
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,252
- Yes.
- Oh, good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

121
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,881
- I'd like a word with you, sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

122
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:28,801
No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

123
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,306
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

124
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:37,519
Oh, yeah. Well, we have automatic timers
for our lights, locks for our doors.

125
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,729
That's about as well
as anybody can do these days.

126
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,023
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on, Dad.

127
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,025
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

128
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,382
- Eggnog? Listen, are you
gonna be leaving, uh...

129
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,136
- Pizza! Pizza!

130
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,155
Pizza!

131
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,325
Grab yourself a napkin.
You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.

132
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,536
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

133
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,871
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

134
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,457
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

135
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,795
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

136
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:07,056
Honey, the pizza boy needs
$122.50, plus a tip.

137
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,074
For pizza?

138
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,009
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

139
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,637
- Frank, you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

140
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,598
Forget it, Frank.
We have cash.

141
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,351
You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.

142
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,437
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

143
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,982
Oh, yeah, we did.
But if you want any...

144
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,318
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up, 'cause it's gone.

145
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:30,947
Fuller!
Go easy on the Pepsi.

146
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:41,124
Kev! Kevin, get a plate.

147
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,049
Wow!

148
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:52,969
The passports! Watch it!

149
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,181
Help me out here!

150
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:59,100
Let's get these passports
out of here.

151
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,687
- Kevin, get off of him!
- You moron!

152
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:06,357
Are you okay, honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

153
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,234
What is the matter with you?

154
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,237
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

155
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,615
He knows I hate sausage
and olives and...

156
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,159
Look what you did,
you little jerk!

157
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,300
- Kevin, get upstairs right now.
- Why?

158
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:35,637
- Kevin, you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

159
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,472
- Kevin, upstairs!
- Say good night, Kevin.

160
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:41,851
- Good night, Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

161
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,270
Why do I always get treated
like scum?

162
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,731
Oh, I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

163
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,733
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

164
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,487
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

165
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,198
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

166
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,325
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

167
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,869
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

168
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,871
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

169
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:05,875
and his kids are still going to school here,
and I guess he missed the whole family.

170
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,586
He's giving us this trip to Paris
so we can be together.

171
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:12,465
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

172
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,843
Excellent. Excellent.

173
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:18,096
If you'll excuse me, this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

174
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,015
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband already.

175
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,309
And don't worry
about your home.

176
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,812
It's in good hands.

177
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:32,151
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

178
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:35,321
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

179
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:40,034
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs, dummy.

180
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,704
- The third floor?
- Go.

181
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,040
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

182
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,335
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

183
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,629
He'll pee all over me.
I know it.

184
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,756
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,384
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,012
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

187
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,100
Everyone in this family hates me.

188
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:06,436
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

189
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,190
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

190
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:13,484
Stay up there. I don't want to
see you for the rest of the night.

191
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,237
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

192
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,032
And I don't want to see
anybody else either.

193
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:21,117
I hope you don't mean that.

194
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:25,163
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

195
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:28,791
- No, I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.

196
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,296
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,445
I wish they would all just disappear.

198
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:57,630
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

199
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,475
Peter!

200
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,519
We slept in!

201
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,289
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

202
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,834
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando, Florida.

203
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:38,588
Well, actually, first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

204
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,257
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

205
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,136
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

206
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,181
Gee, kid, I don't know.
Hit the road.

207
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,186
Heather, do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

208
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,188
Where are the passports
and tickets?

209
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:57,190
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

210
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:59,192
How fast does this thing go?

211
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:03,238
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

212
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:07,534
Look, I told you before, kid,
don't bother me. Now beat it.

213
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,960
Come on. Hurry up.

214
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,549
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

215
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:25,009
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

216
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,762
Shut up.
I gotta take a head count.

217
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:31,975
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Eleven, 92, 12.

218
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,477
Buzz, don't be a moron.

219
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:37,772
Six, seven, eight...

220
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,441
nine, 10, 11.

221
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,736
Okay. Half in this van, half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

222
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:46,364
Have a good trip.

223
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,491
Bring me back something French.

224
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:55,164
There's no way on earth we're gonna
make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

225
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:58,585
- Think positive, Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

226
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,587
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

227
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,672
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

228
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:06,259
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

229
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,803
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay, thanks.

230
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:12,265
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven, including me.

231
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:17,145
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

232
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,846
This way!

233
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:55,433
- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?

234
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:58,102
No, you just made it.

235
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:02,315
- Single seats only in coach. Take whatever's free.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,609
I get a window seat!

237
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,030
You kids are in coach.
We're up here.

238
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,866
Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B"
and four "A"and "B."

239
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,869
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

240
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,871
Fasten your seat belts, please.

241
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,541
- Champagne, please. It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

242
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,294
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

243
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:25,547
Hope we didn't forget anything.

244
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,927
What are you doing
out of costume?

245
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:14,929
Now get back and get dressed.

246
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,215
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

247
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,142
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

248
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,352
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

249
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,522
It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man...

250
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,697
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!

251
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,451
But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

252
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,453
I ought to take this cane and...

253
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:43,166
Julia, get some black
coffee and plenty of it.

254
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,210
Black with a little cream.

255
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:47,504
Mom?

256
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:55,261
Thank you.

257
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:58,556
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

258
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,894
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

259
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,938
Put them in your purse!

260
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:09,150
Uh, yeah, yeah, fill it up, fill it up.
Fill it up, please.

261
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,152
Thank you.

262
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:14,656
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

263
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,658
No, the kids are fine.

264
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:20,912
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the
family station wagon, and it wasn't to France.

265
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,332
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

266
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,738
The kids are okay. They're
having the time of their lives.

267
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:27,318
Yeah.

268
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,380
Hello?

269
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,508
Mom?

270
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,262
Dad?

271
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,393
Mom? Dad?

272
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,147
Where are you guys?

273
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,233
Buzz?

274
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,611
Buzz?

275
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:58,575
Buzz?

276
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,205
Megan?

277
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,877
Hello? Hello?

278
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:11,963
Rod? Uncle Frank?

279
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,382
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

280
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,179
Megan? Linnie?

281
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,766
Is this a joke?

282
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:51,461
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

283
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:12,065
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

284
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,753
I made my family disappear.

285
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:37,048
Kevin, you're completely helpless.

286
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:41,719
You know, Kevin, you're what
the French call les incompetents.

287
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,056
Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.

288
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,142
Kevin, you are such a disease.

289
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,436
There are 15 people
in this house...

290
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,356
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

291
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,776
Look what you did,
you little jerk.

292
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,741
I made my family disappear.

293
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:22,135
I'm free! Free! Free!

294
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,022
Wow!

295
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:43,698
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

296
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:47,952
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

297
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:51,039
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff!

298
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:54,083
You better come out
and pound me!

299
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,673
Buzz, your girlfriend!
Woof!

300
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,432
Who is it?

301
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,814
It's me, Snakes.
I got the stuff.

302
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:01,025
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

303
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,320
All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?

304
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:07,949
- What money?
- Acey said you had some dough for me.

305
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:11,035
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?

306
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,997
Acey said 10%.

307
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,791
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

308
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,794
- What do you mean?
- Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

309
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,881
You better come out
and stop me!

310
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:25,592
He'll call you when he gets out.

311
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,385
Hey.

312
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,221
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you, Snakes.

313
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,142
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

314
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:37,353
to get your ugly, yellow...

315
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:39,564
no-good keister off my property...

316
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,774
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

317
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,444
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

318
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,071
One, two, ten!

319
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,797
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

320
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,009
Mom!

321
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,940
What's the matter?

322
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,442
Honey?

323
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:28,071
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

324
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,282
That we didn't do something.

325
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:34,702
Oh, no, you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

326
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,855
We took care of everything.
Believe me, we did.

327
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,189
Did I turn off the coffee?

328
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,125
No. I did.

329
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,211
Did you lock up?

330
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:45,213
Yeah.

331
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:47,966
Did you close the garage?

332
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:53,805
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

333
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,729
No, that's not it.

334
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:05,108
What else could we be forgetting?

335
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:11,239
Kevin!

336
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:40,143
Whoa!

337
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:44,939
Whoa! Whoa!

338
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,868
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

339
00:26:56,993 --> 00:27:01,414
We'll call as soon as we land, Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

340
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:05,126
It's horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.

341
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:08,296
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

342
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,673
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

343
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,052
What kind of mother am I?

344
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:17,889
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

345
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:25,230
Five families gone on one block alone.

346
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,233
- They all told me from their own mouths.

347
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,276
It's almost too easy.

348
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:34,280
Check it out. All the houses
with nobody home...

349
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:37,492
have automatic timers
on their lights.

350
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:40,453
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

351
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,458
Number 664 will be going on...

352
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,795
right about... now.

353
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,591
- Oh.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

354
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,261
Number 672...

355
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,223
right... now.

356
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:03,518
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

357
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:07,856
671... now.

358
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:13,319
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

359
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,572
Oh, it's very "G."

360
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:18,616
Very "G, " huh?
It's loaded.

361
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,160
It's got lots of topflight goods.

362
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:24,664
- Stereos, VCR's.
- Toys.

363
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:29,252
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

364
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:33,590
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

365
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:35,884
It's a gem.

366
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:37,969
Grab your crowbar.

367
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,181
Crowbars up.

368
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:40,965
Which way?

369
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,227
We'll go around back to the basement.
Follow me.

370
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:06,182
I thought you said
they were gone.

371
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:10,103
- They were supposed to leave this morning.
- Let's get out of here.

372
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:49,184
We have to use the phone, please.

373
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:52,061
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

374
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:55,190
Please! Our brother's home alone.

375
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:58,526
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

376
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:01,613
Peter, I'm gonna call the police.
Why don't you book us a flight home.

377
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:06,367
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

378
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:09,662
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.

379
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,664
Maybe somebody can help us.

380
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,877
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

381
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:24,928
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

382
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:29,140
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

383
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:39,317
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

384
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:44,739
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

385
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:47,700
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore!

386
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,650
Village Police Department.

387
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:24,279
Hi. Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

388
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:27,782
Our phones are out of order,
so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

389
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:29,784
and tell him we're
coming home to get him.

390
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:31,953
Let me connect you with
Family Crisis Intervention.

391
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,914
- It's not a family crisis.
- Hold on.

392
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,295
Larry, can you pick up? There's some
lady on hold, sounds kind of hyper.

393
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,131
- What line, Rose?
- Uh, two.

394
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,842
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

395
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:48,928
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

396
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,930
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

397
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:53,850
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

398
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:57,896
- No.
- Has he been involved in a household accident?

399
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:00,231
I don't know. I don't...
I hope not.

400
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:02,817
Has the child ingested any poison...

401
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:05,612
and/or any other object that has become
lodged in his throat?

402
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,324
No, he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

403
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:12,285
and see that he's all right,
just to check on him.

404
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:15,997
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

405
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:16,806
Yes!

406
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:19,567
Let me connect you with
the police department.

407
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,128
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

408
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:24,672
- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on, please.

409
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:28,718
No, please don't hang up.
Please, don't... Any luck?

410
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:32,430
No. We couldn't get anybody.

411
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:33,314
Leslie?

412
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,376
I'm sorry, Kate. Nothing but a
bunch of answering machines.

413
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:42,232
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

414
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:44,859
- Hi, ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah, hi. Look.

415
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:47,820
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I...

416
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:51,908
Okay, okay. We'll send a policeman
over to your house to check on your son.

417
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:24,816
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

418
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,986
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
Ten-four.

419
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:30,655
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody...

420
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,449
I'm sorry, but there's
no way I can do that.

421
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,451
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

422
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:38,079
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could...

423
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:40,724
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

424
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,086
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
- There's nothing to Chicago?

425
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:48,506
There's nothing to Chicago, New York,
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

426
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:53,052
- What about a private plane?
- No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

427
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:56,139
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

428
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:58,474
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

429
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:01,060
Look, honey, the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

430
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:03,771
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

431
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:07,984
I say we go to Rob's, we can call the
police, and they can get back to us.

432
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:11,905
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

433
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:13,907
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

434
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,911
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on a standby.

435
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:21,456
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

436
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:24,667
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

437
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:33,384
- Bye. I'll miss you.
- Bye.

438
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,429
- Find Kevin.

439
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:38,515
Don't you get lost.

440
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:40,725
Good-bye.

441
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,769
Good-bye, Kate.

442
00:35:56,616 --> 00:36:00,119
I took a shower, washing
every body part with actual soap...

443
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:04,749
including all my major crevices, including
in between my toes and in my belly button...

444
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,293
which I never did before,
but sort of enjoyed.

445
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:10,046
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

446
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:13,299
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

447
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:17,428
I can't seem to find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

448
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,556
Other than that,
I'm in good shape.

449
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,842
Whoa!

450
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:12,984
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

451
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:43,014
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

452
00:37:58,905 --> 00:38:02,450
You know, you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world, Marv.

453
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:04,575
You think you could keep
it down a little in there?

454
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:10,041
Hi, you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.

455
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:14,921
Chuck, this is Peter McCallister again, and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

456
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:18,132
Let me give you the number here, okay?
The country code is 3-3.

457
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:20,134
The area code is 1-4.

458
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,472
- And the number is 694-8764.
- Hey, Harry?

459
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:25,390
Yeah?

460
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:28,585
House we were at last night,
was that the McCallisters?

461
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,104
- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.

462
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:33,773
You're right. They're gone.

463
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:40,029
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

464
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:44,158
Wow.

465
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:51,249
How may I help you?

466
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:55,211
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

467
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:58,089
Well, I don't know.

468
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:01,968
- It doesn't say, hon.
- Can you please find out?

469
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:06,973
- Herb!
- Yeah?

470
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:10,894
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

471
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:20,737
Do you know, is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

472
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,739
I don't know.

473
00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:48,014
- Just tell him that...
- Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

474
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,016
Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?

475
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,436
Wait, son, you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?

476
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,522
Son! Hey!

477
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:59,317
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

478
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,074
Hey! Hey!

479
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:09,786
Shoplifter!

480
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,874
Hey! Hey, kid!

481
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,585
Come back here!

482
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,421
Watch it!

483
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,591
Come back here!

484
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:27,595
Stop it, will ya!
Come here!

485
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:32,392
Whoa! Whoa!

486
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,397
Whoa! Whoa!

487
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:42,360
Yeehaw!

488
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:08,178
I'm a criminal.

489
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:38,082
What's so funny?

490
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,835
What's so funny?
What are you laughin' at?

491
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:45,465
You did it again, didn't you?

492
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:48,218
You left the water runnin', didn't you?

493
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:51,513
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

494
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:53,515
Harry, it's our calling card.

495
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,351
- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.

496
00:41:56,476 --> 00:41:58,353
We're the "Wet Bandits."

497
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:01,314
You're sick, you know that?
You're really sick.

498
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,316
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

499
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,360
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

500
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:14,802
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.

501
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:16,145
I can do it if I want to.

502
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,998
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

503
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:22,210
- Hey, watch out!

504
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:32,303
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic, son, you know?

505
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:34,848
- Sorry.
- Damn.

506
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,183
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, little buddy.

507
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:39,477
Okay, okay.

508
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:42,897
Merry Christmas.

509
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:55,702
- What's the matter?
- I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

510
00:42:55,785 --> 00:42:57,704
- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?

511
00:42:57,787 --> 00:43:00,498
I saw a hundred kids this week.

512
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:03,084
Let's see what house
he goes into.

513
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:36,993
Why is he goin' faster?

514
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:41,497
I told you something's wrong. I knew
he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

515
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:20,954
- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.

516
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:23,831
- Me neither.
- Ah, let's get out of here.

517
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:45,603
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

518
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:13,840
- Did they come back?
- From Paris?

519
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:52,462
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone by then.

520
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:56,633
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees us.

521
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,539
Attention! Attention!

522
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:31,584
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen!
- Frank, those are for later.

523
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:33,628
Frank?

524
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:38,883
Mes petites enfants,
do you want a little shrimp, eh?

525
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:42,220
Oper... Do you speak English?

526
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:45,139
Parlez anglais?

527
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:47,225
Is there... I mean...

528
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:52,272
Est ce qui un person
qui parle anglais?

529
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:55,400
- Did you get anybody?
- I'm looking for my son! Do you know where he is?

530
00:46:55,525 --> 00:47:00,822
I can't find anybody. They've all gone
shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

531
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:03,032
Never mind. Forget it.

532
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:05,159
This is so pointless.

533
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:08,997
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

534
00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:11,291
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

535
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,710
- So?
- You're not at all worried about Kevin?

536
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:15,712
Why should I be?

537
00:47:15,795 --> 00:47:19,340
He's acted like a jerk too many times,
and this time he caught it in the butt.

538
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:23,970
But he's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

539
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:27,265
The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.

540
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,726
You're not worried that something
might happen to him?

541
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:32,312
No. For three reasons.

542
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:35,023
I'm not that lucky.

543
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:37,442
Two: We have smoke detectors.

544
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:41,487
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America...

545
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:45,992
where nothing even remotely dangerous
will ever happen, period.

546
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:16,523
- Who is it?
- It's Little Nero's, sir. I have your pizza.

547
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:19,817
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

548
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:22,695
Okay.

549
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,989
Um, well, what about the money?

550
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,825
What money?

551
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:31,371
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

552
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:33,665
Is that a fact?

553
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,959
How much do I owe you?

554
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:39,337
Uh, that'll be 11.80, sir.

555
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:49,055
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

556
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:52,851
- Cheapskate.
- Hey.

557
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:56,729
I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly...

558
00:48:56,855 --> 00:49:00,149
yellow, no-good keister
off my property...

559
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:02,443
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

560
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:04,445
One, two, ten!

561
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:36,436
A lovely cheese pizza
just for me.

562
00:49:39,939 --> 00:49:42,108
To Dallas-Fort Worth.

563
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,906
We have the $500,
the pocket translator...

564
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,700
the two first-class seats...
that's an upgrade from your coach...

565
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:54,579
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

566
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:57,373
- No.
- But who can tell?

567
00:49:57,457 --> 00:50:01,419
- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!

568
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:04,047
Come on. They're boarding.

569
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,634
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

570
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:11,262
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...

571
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:14,098
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

572
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:16,851
A whole shoe box full of' em.
Dangley ones.

573
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:18,937
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...

574
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:21,064
I'm desperate.

575
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:23,024
I'm begging you.

576
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:26,569
From a mother to a mother, please.

577
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,657
- Oh, Ed.
- Please.

578
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:33,451
Oh, all right.

579
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,125
"Dear Santa Claus.
I got a little sister last year.

580
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,419
This year I'd rather
have some clay dough."

581
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,435
I didn't mean it.

582
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,689
If you come back,
I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

583
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,775
I promise. Good night.

584
00:51:25,962 --> 00:51:29,132

585
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:30,592

Are those microwave dinners

593
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:52,799
- I don't know.
- I'll give 'em a whirl.

594
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,848
For the kids.

595
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:04,769
Hold on.
I got a coupon for that.

596
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,564
It was in the paper this morning.

597
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,987
- 19.83.
- Okay.

598
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,617
Are you here all by yourself?

599
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,248
Ma'am, I'm eight years old.
You think I would be here alone?

600
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:27,667
I don't think so.

601
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,044
- Where's your mom?
- My mom's in the car.

602
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,547
- And where is your father?
- He's at work.

603
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:35,425
- What about your brothers and your sisters?
- I'm an only child.

604
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:38,011
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

605
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:41,139
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

606
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:23,014
Hello, Kevin!

607
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:27,685
Shut up.

608
00:54:40,698 --> 00:54:42,575
I don't get it.

609
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,370
I mean, right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

610
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:49,040
Last night the place is jumpin'.

611
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:52,877
Somethin' ain't right.
Go check it out.

612
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:03,388
Now?

613
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,390
No, tomorrow, egghead. Now!

614
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,142
Go ahead!

615
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:10,436
"Now?"

616
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:30,123
Shit.

617
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,878
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right, Johnny.

618
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:38,089
- But what about my money?
- What money?

619
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:40,884
Acey said you had
some dough for me.

620
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:45,889
- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?
- Acey said 10%.

621
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:50,977
- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?

622
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:54,480
He's upstairs taking a bath.

623
00:55:54,606 --> 00:55:57,275
He'll call you when he gets out.

624
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,277
Hey.

625
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:02,405
I tell you what
I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

626
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:06,326
- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

627
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:08,745
to get your ugly, yellow...

628
00:56:08,828 --> 00:56:13,291
no-good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

629
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:16,085
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

630
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:19,130
One, two, ten!

631
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:41,528
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

632
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,408
What happened?

633
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:49,936
I don't know who's in there, but
somebody just got blown away!

634
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:50,495
- Huh?

635
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,522
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

636
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:56,626
Two of' em. They was arguing.
One of' em blew the other one away.

637
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,419
- Who?
- I don't know.

638
00:56:58,503 --> 00:57:00,964
I thought I recognized
one of their voices.

639
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:04,259
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

640
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:06,845
Snakes? Snakes, Snakes.

641
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,055
- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.

642
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,724
Let's get out of here.

643
00:57:14,143 --> 00:57:16,813
Hold it, hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

644
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:18,815
We work this neighborhood too.

645
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:21,693
- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...

646
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:24,821
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

647
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:28,032
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with their questions?

648
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:31,870
That's a good idea.

649
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:35,415
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

650
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,418
He sounded like a snake.

651
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:45,592
Everything's full.

652
00:57:45,717 --> 00:57:47,594
Everything's full?

653
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,929
I'm very sorry,
but it is Christmas Eve.

654
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:52,182
What about another airline?

655
00:57:57,604 --> 00:58:00,565
Nothing available. May I help you
get a hotel room in the city?

656
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,984
Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.

657
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,219
I can't wait that long.

658
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:08,698
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

659
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:15,997
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go, people to see.

660
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,417
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

661
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:23,546
I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

662
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,092
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to... Where the hell am I?

663
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:30,220
Scranton.

664
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:32,972
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

665
00:58:33,097 --> 00:58:36,476
And now that I'm this close,
you're telling me it's hopeless?

666
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:40,230
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no, no way. This is Christmas!

667
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:42,232
The season of perpetual hope!

668
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:43,106
Ma'am, if I...

669
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:46,135
If I have to get out on
your runway and hitchhike...

670
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,154
if it costs me everything I own...

671
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:51,115
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

672
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:54,410
I am going to get home
to my son.

673
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:57,797
Ma'am, if there was anything at
all I could do for you today...

674
00:58:57,823 --> 00:58:58,648
Do it.

675
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:01,334
- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.

676
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:03,878
- What?
- Excuse me.

677
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:09,676
Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see
you for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.

678
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,971
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

679
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:15,682
We got a crisis ourselves.

680
00:59:15,807 --> 00:59:19,227
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

681
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:22,772
Polka king of the Midwest?

682
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,403
The Kenosha Kickers?

683
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:30,154
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

684
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,116
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized...

685
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,160
Anyways, uh, I had
a few hits a few years ago.

686
00:59:36,244 --> 00:59:39,539
Uh, that's why, you know...
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

687
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,127
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

688
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,672
"Yamahoozie Polka,"
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

689
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:50,425
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

690
00:59:50,508 --> 00:59:53,928
Yeah. Yeah. We...
Some fairly big hits for us.

691
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,639
- You know, in the early '70s, you know?
- Oh.

692
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:59,350
Yeah, we sold
about 623 copies of that.

693
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:02,103
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

694
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:04,355
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

695
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,608
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.

696
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:09,777
Our flight was canceled,
so we gotta drive.

697
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:13,448
So, uh, see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

698
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:17,285
He's gonna rent us a nice big, uh, van,
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.

699
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:21,664
I heard you had some problems here, uh, gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

700
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:25,877
Uh, my son. He...
We left and he's there.

701
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:30,089
Aw, geez. If you have to get
to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you.

702
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:32,467
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

703
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,178
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not, you know?

704
01:00:35,303 --> 01:00:37,847
- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?

705
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:39,807
Sure. You know,
it's Christmastime.

706
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:42,435
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

707
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,854
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

708
01:00:44,938 --> 01:00:46,856
No, I'd love to.

709
01:01:08,586 --> 01:01:11,464
- Hey, Marv, Marv, Marv.
- What?

710
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:14,050
Look at this.

711
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:22,976
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

712
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,633
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

713
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:04,392
Remember that kid we saw
the other day? He lives here.

714
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:07,395
Well, if the kid's there,
the parents gotta be.

715
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:10,064
He's home alone.

716
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:20,283
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

717
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:22,285
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

718
01:02:22,368 --> 01:02:24,495
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

719
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:28,082
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

720
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,877
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house, I wanted it.

721
01:02:31,002 --> 01:02:33,338
So let's take it
one step at a time, okay?

722
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:36,925
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

723
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,969
- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.

724
01:02:40,053 --> 01:02:43,181
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

725
01:02:43,306 --> 01:02:46,142
You're afraid of the dark too, Marv.
You know you are.

726
01:02:46,226 --> 01:02:48,937
No, I'm not!

727
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,523
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not, not, not.

728
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:55,860
- You are so.
- Mom, where are you?

729
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:11,167
Do you play?

730
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:13,336
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

731
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:15,672
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

732
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,841
Okay.

733
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:45,493
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

734
01:03:45,618 --> 01:03:49,581
- Hey, nice shoes.
- Oh, thanks.

735
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,334
Is he still here? It's really important
that I see him.

736
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:58,715
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry, you can catch him.

737
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,261
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris
Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

738
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:06,472
What's next?
Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

739
01:04:06,598 --> 01:04:09,184
Santa, hold on!

740
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:11,394
Can I talk to you for a minute?

741
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:14,480
If you make it quick. Santa's got
a little get-together he's late for.

742
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:16,482
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

743
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:20,486
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

744
01:04:20,612 --> 01:04:23,239
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

745
01:04:23,323 --> 01:04:26,409
- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.

746
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:29,537
- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

747
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:33,750
I'm Kevin McCallister,
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

748
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:36,503
- Do you need the phone number?
- No, that's all right.

749
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,796
Okay.
This is extremely important.

750
01:04:38,922 --> 01:04:43,718
Would you please tell him that, instead of
presents this year, I just want my family back.

751
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:48,723
No toys. Nothing but Peter,
Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

752
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:51,017
And my aunt and my cousins.

753
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:54,312
And, if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

754
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:59,192
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

755
01:04:59,317 --> 01:05:02,237
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

756
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,448
My elf took the last of the candy canes
home to her boyfriend.

757
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:07,617
- That's okay.
- No, no, no. Don't be silly.

758
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,703
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

759
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:12,997
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

760
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:16,209
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

761
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:18,920
I won't. Thanks.

762
01:05:29,848 --> 01:05:32,392
Son of a...

763
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:30,820
Merry Christmas.

764
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,363
Huh?

765
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,532
May I sit down?

766
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:49,506
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

767
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:53,384
She's about your age.

768
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,720
- Do you know her?
- No.

769
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:58,890
- You live next to me, don't you?
- Yeah.

770
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:03,478
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

771
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:07,482
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true.

772
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:09,484
Okay?

773
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,778
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

774
01:09:11,903 --> 01:09:13,988
Swear to it?

775
01:09:14,072 --> 01:09:16,783
- No.
- Yeah, I had a feeling.

776
01:09:16,908 --> 01:09:20,036
Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

777
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:23,039
- It is?
- I think so.

778
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:25,834
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

779
01:09:30,088 --> 01:09:32,340
I've been kind of a pain lately.

780
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:34,843
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

781
01:09:34,926 --> 01:09:38,221
I really haven't been
too good this year.

782
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:41,140
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...

783
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:43,393
because I really like my family.

784
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:46,020
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

785
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:49,566
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

786
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:54,153
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

787
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:57,740
Especially with an older brother.

788
01:09:57,866 --> 01:10:02,120
Deep down you always love 'em,
but you can forget that you love 'em.

789
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:04,914
And you can hurt them,
and they can hurt you.

790
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,751
And that's not just
because you're young.

791
01:10:08,877 --> 01:10:12,088
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

792
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:14,132
Sure.

793
01:10:14,215 --> 01:10:17,844
I came to hear my granddaughter sing,
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

794
01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:23,600
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

795
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:27,520
- At church?
- Oh, you're always welcome at church.

796
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:30,023
I'm not welcome with my son.

797
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:34,819
Years back, before you and
your family moved on the block...

798
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:37,405
I had an argument with my son.

799
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,784
- How old is he?
- Oh, he's grown up.

800
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:44,495
We lost our tempers...

801
01:10:44,621 --> 01:10:47,582
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

802
01:10:47,665 --> 01:10:52,587
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

803
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,507
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

804
01:10:55,632 --> 01:10:58,301
I'm afraid if I call him,
he won't talk to me.

805
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:00,637
How do you know?

806
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,723
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

807
01:11:03,848 --> 01:11:07,519
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

808
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:11,147
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

809
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:13,483
You're never too old
to be afraid.

810
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:16,361
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

811
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:19,906
It's dark, there's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

812
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,409
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

813
01:11:23,535 --> 01:11:25,954
Basements are like that.

814
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:28,957
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

815
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,042
and I found out
it's not so bad.

816
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,419
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

817
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:35,797
but if you turn on the lights,
it's no big deal.

818
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,343
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

819
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:42,512
What if he won't talk to me?

820
01:11:42,595 --> 01:11:45,932
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

821
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:48,643
and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.

822
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:52,313
I don't care how mad I was,
I'd talk to my dad...

823
01:11:52,397 --> 01:11:54,315
especially around the holidays.

824
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:57,527
I don't know.

825
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:00,822
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

826
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:04,284
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

827
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:06,244
I send her a check.

828
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:10,665
I wish my grandparents sent that.
They always send me clothes.

829
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:13,668
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

830
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:17,046
- Oh, that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

831
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:20,091
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

832
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:22,343
- Oh?
- Yeah.

833
01:12:22,427 --> 01:12:26,556
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

834
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:29,934
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

835
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:31,936
You think about what I said.

836
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:33,813
- All right?
- Okay.

837
01:12:33,938 --> 01:12:37,817
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

838
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:47,035
- What about you?
- Me?

839
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:49,120
Yeah. You and your son.

840
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:52,540
We'll see what happens.

841
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:55,585
Merry Christmas.

842
01:12:55,668 --> 01:12:57,587
Merry Christmas.

843
01:13:50,348 --> 01:13:54,352
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

844
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,818
Okay, we'll check it out first.
We can always come back for the truck.

845
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,702
How do you wanna go in?

846
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:38,248
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

847
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:41,793
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

848
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:47,757
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

849
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,884
and the people
who sold it on sale.

850
01:15:49,968 --> 01:15:51,886
Amen.

851
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,621
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

852
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:34,387
Merry Christmas, little fella.

853
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:37,056
We know that you're in there...

854
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:40,059
and that you're all alone.

855
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:42,812
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

856
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:46,441
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

857
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:50,111
We're not gonna hurt you.

858
01:16:50,195 --> 01:16:54,157
No, no. We got
some nice presents for you.

859
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,702
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

860
01:17:00,622 --> 01:17:03,374
Shoot!

861
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:07,253
What? What? What?

862
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:10,381
What? What happened?

863
01:17:10,507 --> 01:17:14,052
Get that little...

864
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:25,563
Hello.

865
01:17:30,902 --> 01:17:33,363
Yes! Yes!

866
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:35,532
The little jerk is armed!

867
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:39,536
That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around
the front! You go down the basement!

868
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:42,080
That little...

869
01:18:18,366 --> 01:18:20,410
Ow!

870
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:44,267
That smart aleck.

871
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:16,943
Oh, boy, that's it, you little...
you little son of a...

872
01:20:17,068 --> 01:20:20,029
Oh, not this time,
you little brat.

873
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:26,077
You little creep, you,
where are you?

874
01:20:26,202 --> 01:20:30,373
Where are you, you little creep?

875
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:54,022
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

876
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:27,555
I'll rip his head off!

877
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:38,525
You're dead, kid.

878
01:22:25,572 --> 01:22:28,700
Where are you,
you little creep?

879
01:22:44,048 --> 01:22:47,677
Harry! I'm comin' in!

880
01:22:52,307 --> 01:22:54,684
Oh, no, I'm really scared!

881
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:57,437
It's too late for you, kid.
We're already in the house.

882
01:22:57,562 --> 01:23:01,608
- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.

883
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:04,277
Why, you...

884
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:11,201
Now you're dead!

885
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:37,977
I'm gonna kill that kid!

886
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,495
- Marv!
- Harry?

887
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,622
Why the hell'd
you take your shoes off?

888
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:00,875
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

889
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:06,047
I'm up here, you morons!
Come and get me!

890
01:24:08,258 --> 01:24:11,928
You guys give up,
or are you thirsty for more?

891
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:24,107
- Heads up!
- Huh?

892
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:27,360
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

893
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:30,989
Ow!

894
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:34,492
Yes!

895
01:24:38,663 --> 01:24:41,374
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

896
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:43,459
- Aw, shut up, will ya!
- Oh!

897
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:46,588
- What is it?
- You're missin' some teeth.

898
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:50,884
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth! I'll kill him!

899
01:24:51,009 --> 01:24:54,387
I'll kill him!

900
01:24:54,512 --> 01:24:57,307
You bomb me
with one more can, kid...

901
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:01,561
and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

902
01:25:04,022 --> 01:25:06,149
911 Emergency.

903
01:25:06,232 --> 01:25:08,985
Help. My house is being robbed.

904
01:25:09,068 --> 01:25:13,656
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

905
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:18,912
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

906
01:25:19,037 --> 01:25:21,915
There he is!

907
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:26,169
Ah! I got ya!

908
01:25:26,252 --> 01:25:29,631
I got him, Harry!
Harry, I got him!

909
01:25:29,714 --> 01:25:32,800
Harry, get up! Give me a hand!

910
01:25:32,884 --> 01:25:37,055
Ow! I got him!

911
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:40,642
Harry, help me! Get up!

912
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:43,520
I got him!

913
01:26:22,058 --> 01:26:26,896
- What are you doing, Marv?
- Harry, don't move.

914
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,942
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

915
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:34,362
Marv, what are you doing?
Marv...

916
01:26:37,448 --> 01:26:41,035
Did I get him?
Did I get him?

917
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:43,454
Where is it?
Where is it?

918
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:46,749
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it? Huh?

919
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:50,628
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

920
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:57,427
Whoa! Whoa!

921
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:00,972
Whoa! Whoa!

922
01:27:01,097 --> 01:27:04,225
Whoa! Whoa!

923
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:18,907
Where'd he go?

924
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:21,034
Maybe he committed suicide.

925
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:23,286
Down here, you big horse's ass!

926
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:26,331
Come and get me
before I call the police!

927
01:27:26,456 --> 01:27:28,625
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

928
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,668
That's just what
he wants us to do...

929
01:27:30,793 --> 01:27:34,255
us to go back downstairs through
his fun house so we get all tore up.

930
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,592
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the... From a tree house?

931
01:27:37,675 --> 01:27:39,594
Come on.

932
01:27:39,677 --> 01:27:41,971
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

933
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:44,724
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared, Marv?

934
01:27:44,849 --> 01:27:47,435
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

935
01:27:52,023 --> 01:27:53,942
Come on.

936
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:58,073
Come on!

937
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:08,414
Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

938
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,501
- Let's go back, Harry.
- Shut up!

939
01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:14,838
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

940
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:17,757
Shut it, Marv!

941
01:28:20,218 --> 01:28:23,137
Hey, guys, check this out.

942
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:26,015
Go back! Go back!

943
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:27,600
- Go back.
- Okay.

944
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:56,838
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way, you dope!

945
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:19,194
- There he is!
- Hey, I'm calling the cops.

946
01:29:19,277 --> 01:29:22,197
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He wants us to follow him.

947
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,407
I got a better idea.
Come on.

948
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:45,678
Hiya, pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

949
01:29:45,803 --> 01:29:48,765
Get over here!

950
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,312
What are we
gonna do to him, Harry?

951
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:58,816
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

952
01:29:58,942 --> 01:30:01,069
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

953
01:30:01,152 --> 01:30:05,073
I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.

954
01:30:05,156 --> 01:30:07,659
Or shove a nail through his foot.

955
01:30:07,784 --> 01:30:11,037
I'm gonna bite off every one
of these little fingers one at a time.

956
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:22,966
Come on.
Let's get you home.

957
01:30:44,696 --> 01:30:48,867
Wow. This is great.

958
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:54,372
Nice move... always leaving
the water running.

959
01:30:54,497 --> 01:30:57,709
Now we know each and
every house that you've hit.

960
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:04,340
Hey, you know, we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

961
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:07,385
- Yeah.
- Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

962
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:11,639
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

963
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:14,559
Hey, come on. Come on.

964
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:17,020
- Hands off the head, pal!
- Come on!

965
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:15,286
I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.

966
01:32:15,411 --> 01:32:18,373
You're not. You know, you're beating
yourself up there, you know.

967
01:32:18,456 --> 01:32:21,000
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know, you...

968
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:24,504
Gee, you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at... Look at us.

969
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:29,050
I mean, we're on the road 48, 49 weeks out of the year.
We hardly see our families.

970
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:32,512
Uh, Joe over there... Gosh, you know, he...

971
01:32:32,637 --> 01:32:35,348
He forgets his kids' names
half the time.

972
01:32:35,473 --> 01:32:39,185
Ziggy over there... He doesn't even...
He's never even met his kid.

973
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:42,981
Eddie... Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.

974
01:32:43,106 --> 01:32:47,944
Tell me, have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

975
01:32:50,822 --> 01:32:52,866
No.

976
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:56,411
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

977
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:58,746
Yeah, it was...
it was terrible too.

978
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:02,125
You know, I was all distraught and
everything. You know, the wife and I...

979
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:06,254
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

980
01:33:06,337 --> 01:33:10,258
All day. You know, and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

981
01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:13,845
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

982
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:16,598
- Oh!
- Whew, yeah. He was okay, you know.

983
01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:21,603
After six, seven weeks, you know, he
came around and started talking again.

984
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:26,149
But he's okay. You know, they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

985
01:33:26,232 --> 01:33:28,985
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well, you brought it up.

986
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:32,113
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well, I'm sorry I did.

987
01:33:58,014 --> 01:33:59,891
Mom?

988
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:06,356
Mom?

989
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:12,529
Mom?

990
01:34:58,283 --> 01:35:02,328
Kevin? Kevin!

991
01:35:33,318 --> 01:35:35,612
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

992
01:35:44,829 --> 01:35:47,540
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

993
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:09,229
Where is everybody else?

994
01:36:09,354 --> 01:36:13,441
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much, but...

995
01:36:13,525 --> 01:36:18,112
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab
and drool all over you, did I?

996
01:36:18,196 --> 01:36:20,490
- I don't drool.
- You guys, would you shut up!

997
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:23,910
Come on, you guys, it's Christmas.
Kevin! Kevin, Kevin, my boy!

998
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:25,912
- Oh, my God!
- Kevin, how are ya?

999
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:27,914
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Mom.

1000
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:30,792
Good to see you. Ah, you're all right.
I love you. You okay?

1001
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,503
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev.

1002
01:36:35,588 --> 01:36:39,175
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

1003
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:43,054
Thanks, Buzz.

1004
01:36:43,179 --> 01:36:46,057
Wait a minute.
How did you guys get home?

1005
01:36:46,182 --> 01:36:49,519
Oh, we took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

1006
01:36:49,602 --> 01:36:52,272
Oh, no.
Oh, thank you.

1007
01:36:52,397 --> 01:36:54,315
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1008
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:56,956
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

1009
01:36:56,982 --> 01:36:58,469
I went shopping yesterday.

1010
01:37:00,864 --> 01:37:02,657
You? Shopping?

1011
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:05,660
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

1012
01:37:07,203 --> 01:37:09,539
- What?
- No kiddin'?

1013
01:37:09,664 --> 01:37:13,751
What a funny guy. What else did
you do while we were away?

1014
01:37:13,877 --> 01:37:16,754
Just hung around.

1015
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:21,718
You guys,
put the stuff upstairs.

1016
01:37:21,843 --> 01:37:25,680
You went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe, and he's going shopping?

1017
01:37:25,763 --> 01:37:28,516
- Buzz, forget it.
- This is not the Kevin I knew.

1018
01:37:51,956 --> 01:37:54,292
Honey, what's this?

1019
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:55,562
Kevin!
What did you do to my room?
