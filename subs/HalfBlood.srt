<font color="#696969">Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.</font>

<font color="#696969">You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.</font>

18
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,299
<font color="#696969">You've been reckless this summer, Harry.</font>

19
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,802

22
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,915
<font color="#696969">The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.</font>

<font color="#696969">But now is not the time to tell it.</font>

<font color="#696969">I just Apparated, didn't I?</font>

27
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,166
<font color="#696969">Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.</font>

31
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:37,810
<font color="#696969">Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here.</font>

32
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,687
<font color="#696969">Am I right?</font>

33
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:43,232
<font color="#696969">Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.</font>

34
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,696
<font color="#696969">Wands out, Harry.</font>

<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard!</font>

38
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,107
<font color="#696969">No need to disfigure me, Albus.</font>

39
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,965
<font color="#696969">Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.</font>

40
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,283
<font color="#696969">It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?</font>

41
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,202
<font color="#696969">Dragon's blood.</font>

42
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,747
<font color="#696969">~ Oh.
~ Oh, yes, introductions.</font>

43
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,917
<font color="#696969">Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine....</font>

44
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,481
<font color="#696969">....Horace Slughorn.</font>

45
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,150
<font color="#696969">Horace....</font>

46
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,173
<font color="#696969">....well, you know who this is.</font>

47
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,988
<font color="#696969">Harry Potter.</font>

48
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,576
<font color="#696969">What's with all the theatrics, Horace?</font>

49
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,183
<font color="#696969">You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?</font>

50
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,893
<font color="#696969">Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.</font>

51
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,751
<font color="#696969">All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for 
over a year.</font>

52
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,315
<font color="#696969">Do you know what that's like?</font>

53
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,173
<font color="#696969">You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more 
than a week.</font>

54
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,675
<font color="#696969">Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.</font>

55
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,784
<font color="#696969">Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.</font>

56
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,276
<font color="#696969">That was fun.</font>

57
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,238
<font color="#696969">~ Do you mind if I use the loo?
~ No, of course.</font>

58
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,200
<font color="#696969">Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.</font>

59
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,935
<font color="#696969">The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.</font>

60
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,361
<font color="#696969">You're very like your father.</font>

61
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,428
<font color="#696969">~ Except for the eyes. You have your....
~ My mother's eyes. Yeah.</font>

62
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:17,285
<font color="#696969">Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.</font>

63
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,726
<font color="#696969">Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.</font>

64
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,541
<font color="#696969">One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.</font>

65
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,731
<font color="#696969">Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.</font>

66
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:30,110
<font color="#696969">Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.</font>

67
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,091
<font color="#696969">Right at the front.</font>

68
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,560
<font color="#696969">All mine. Each and every one.</font>

69
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,749
<font color="#696969">Ex-students, I mean.</font>

70
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,422
<font color="#696969">You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.</font>

71
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,759
<font color="#696969">Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion....</font>

72
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,218
<font color="#696969">....on the news of the day.</font>

73
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,076
<font color="#696969">Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.</font>

74
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,683
<font color="#696969">Free tickets whenever I want them.</font>

75
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,915
<font color="#696969">Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.</font>

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,147
<font color="#696969">Ah, yes.</font>

77
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,441
<font color="#696969">Regulus Black.</font>

78
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,611
<font color="#696969">You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.</font>

79
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,322
<font color="#696969">I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.</font>

80
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,720
<font color="#696969">It's a shame. Talented boy.</font>

81
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:27,142
<font color="#696969">I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.</font>

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,227
<font color="#696969">Horace?</font>

83
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,521
<font color="#696969">Do you mind if I take this?</font>

84
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,758
<font color="#696969">~ I do love knitting patterns.
~ Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?</font>

85
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,990
<font color="#696969">I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.</font>

86
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,492
<font color="#696969">I would have considered it
a personal triumph....</font>

87
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,620
<font color="#696969">....had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.</font>

88
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,748
<font color="#696969">You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.</font>

89
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,146
<font color="#696969">Well, bye-bye, Horace.</font>

90
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,440
<font color="#696969">Bye.</font>

91
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,994
<font color="#696969">All right. I'll do it.</font>

92
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,686
<font color="#696969">But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water 
closet I had before.</font>

93
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,065
<font color="#696969">And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!</font>

94
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,506
<font color="#696969">They are indeed.</font>

95
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,823
<font color="#696969">Sir, exactly what was all that about?</font>

96
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,037
<font color="#696969">You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.</font>

97
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,686
<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.</font>

98
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,188
<font color="#696969">You would be his crowning jewel.</font>

99
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:44,923
<font color="#696969">That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.</font>

100
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,780
<font color="#696969">I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.</font>

101
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,994
<font color="#696969">She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.</font>

102
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:57,539
<font color="#696969">It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.</font>

103
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:01,396
<font color="#696969">Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.</font>

104
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,628
<font color="#696969">But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?</font>

105
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,444
<font color="#696969">Both are waiting for you.</font>

106
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,476
<font color="#696969">Hedwig.</font>

107
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,334
<font color="#696969">Mum?</font>

108
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,045
<font color="#696969">Ginny, what is it?</font>

109
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,756
<font color="#696969">I was only wondering
when Harry got here.</font>

110
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,092
<font color="#696969">~ What? Harry? Harry who?
~ Harry Potter, of course.</font>

111
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,429
<font color="#696969">I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?</font>

112
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,182
<font color="#696969">~ His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
~ No, dear, I seriously doubt that.</font>

113
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,457
<font color="#696969">Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?</font>

114
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,542
<font color="#696969">Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?</font>

115
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,774
<font color="#696969">Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?</font>

116
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,381
<font color="#696969">~ Is that an owl?
~ You haven't seen him, have you?</font>

117
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,362
<font color="#696969">He's wandering about the house.</font>

118
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,239
<font color="#696969">~ Really?
~ Really.</font>

119
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,115
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

120
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,039
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

121
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,812
<font color="#696969">Hello.</font>

122
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,253
<font color="#696969">What a lovely surprise.</font>

123
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,632
<font color="#696969">Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?</font>

124
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,655
<font color="#696969">~ I didn't know. Dumbledore.
~ Oh, that man.</font>

125
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,053
<font color="#696969">But then, what would we do
without him?</font>

126
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,015
<font color="#696969">Got a bit of toothpaste.</font>

127
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,669
<font color="#696969">So when did you get here?</font>

128
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,546
<font color="#696969">A few days ago.</font>

129
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,778
<font color="#696969">Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.</font>

130
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,844
<font color="#696969">Mum sort of lost it last week.</font>

131
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,972
<font color="#696969">Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.</font>

132
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,536
<font color="#696969">That it's too dangerous.</font>

133
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,560
<font color="#696969">~ Oh, come on.
~ She's not alone.</font>

134
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:16,001
<font color="#696969">Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.</font>

135
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,067
<font color="#696969">Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy....</font>

136
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,778
<font color="#696969">....and it took a few days, but she came around.</font>

137
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:28,095
<font color="#696969">But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?</font>

138
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,953
<font color="#696969">There's been a lot of talk recently that....</font>

139
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,351
<font color="#696969">....Dumbledore's got a bit old.</font>

140
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,332
<font color="#696969">Rubbish! Well, he's only....</font>

141
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,105
<font color="#696969">What is he?</font>

142
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,441
<font color="#696969">Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.</font>

143
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:05,422
<font color="#696969">Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!</font>

144
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,986
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord trusts him.</font>

145
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,739
<font color="#696969">~ The Dark Lord's mistaken.
~ Pfft.</font>

146
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,331
<font color="#696969">Run along, Wormtail.</font>

147
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,753
<font color="#696969">I know I ought not to be here.</font>

148
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,715
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.</font>

149
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,530
<font color="#696969">If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.</font>

150
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,909
<font color="#696969">Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.</font>

151
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,729
<font color="#696969">As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.</font>

152
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,084
<font color="#696969">You?</font>

153
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,525
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord told you?</font>

154
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,653
<font color="#696969">Your sister doubts me.</font>

155
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,510
<font color="#696969">Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.</font>

156
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:22,368
<font color="#696969">So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.</font>

157
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:27,790
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.</font>

158
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,875
<font color="#696969">I don't doubt you, Severus.</font>

159
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,212
<font color="#696969">You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.</font>

160
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,467
<font color="#696969">He's just a boy.</font>

161
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,325
<font color="#696969">I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.</font>

162
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:48,643
<font color="#696969">But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.</font>

163
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,335
<font color="#696969">~ Severus.
~ Swear to it.</font>

164
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,799
<font color="#696969">Make the Unbreakable Vow.</font>

165
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,785
<font color="#696969">It's just empty words.</font>

166
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,121
<font color="#696969">He'll give it his best effort.</font>

167
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,623
<font color="#696969">But when it matters most....</font>

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,462
<font color="#696969">....he'll just slither back into his hole.</font>

169
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,571
<font color="#696969">Coward.</font>

170
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,244
<font color="#696969">Take out your wand.</font>

171
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,528
<font color="#696969">Will you....</font>

172
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,822
<font color="#696969">....Severus Snape....</font>

173
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:49,845
<font color="#696969">....watch over Draco Malfoy....</font>

174
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:54,850

175
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,874
<font color="#696969">I will.</font>

176
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,983
<font color="#696969">And will you,
to the best of your ability....</font>

177

<font color="#696969">....protect him from harm?</font>

178
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:08,613
<font color="#696969">I will.</font>

179
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,200
<font color="#696969">And if Draco should fail....</font>

180
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:18,935
<font color="#696969">....will you yourself carry out the deed....</font>

181
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:24,148
<font color="#696969">....the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?</font>

182
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,821
<font color="#696969">I will.</font>

00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,219
<font color="#696969">One of what?</font>

227
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,389
<font color="#696969">Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.</font>

want with Malfoy?</font>

230
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:37,043
<font color="#696969">Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?</font>

231
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,129
<font color="#696969">It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.</font>

232
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,091
<font color="#696969">Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.</font>

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,863
<font color="#696969">Hermione saw it with her own eyes.</font>

What a pathetic excuse for a school.</font>

241
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:58,265
<font color="#696969">I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower....</font>

242
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,559
<font color="#696969">....if I had to continue
for another two years.</font>

<font color="#696969">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

244
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,231
<font color="#696969">Let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.</font>

<font color="#696969">Amused, Blaise?</font>

it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?</font>

<font color="#696969">....she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.</font>

254
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:33,145
<font color="#696969">That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.</font>

255
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,812
<font color="#696969">Finite.</font>

256
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,215
<font color="#696969">~ Hello, Harry.
~ Luna!</font>

257
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:31,324
<font color="#696969">~ How'd you know where I was?
~ Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.</font>

258
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,708
<font color="#696969">Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.</font>

259
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,044
<font color="#696969">That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.</font>

260
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,233
<font color="#696969">Oh, I am your friend, Luna.</font>

261
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,423
<font color="#696969">That's nice.</font>

262
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,759
<font color="#696969">About time. I've been looking all over for you two.</font>

263
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,783
<font color="#696969">Right. Names?</font>

264
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:57,390
<font color="#696969">Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.</font>

265
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,683
<font color="#696969">No exceptions, Potter.</font>

266
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,977
<font color="#696969">Who are those people?</font>

267
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,480
<font color="#696969">Aurors. For security.</font>

268
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,148
<font color="#696969">What's this cane here, then?</font>

269
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,650
<font color="#696969">It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.</font>

270
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,821
<font color="#696969">And what exactly would you
be wanting with a....?</font>

271
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,096
<font color="#696969">Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.</font>

272
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,517
<font color="#696969">It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.</font>

273
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,797
<font color="#696969">Nice face, Potter.</font>

274
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,763
<font color="#696969">Would you like me to fix it for you?</font>

275
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,621
<font color="#696969">Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way....</font>

276
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,394
<font color="#696969">....but it's up to you.</font>

277
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,104
<font color="#696969">Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?</font>

278
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,962
<font color="#696969">No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?</font>

279
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:57,967
<font color="#696969">Um....Okay, yeah. Give it a go.</font>

280
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,450
<font color="#696969">~ Episkey.
~ Ah!</font>

281
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,730
<font color="#696969">~ How do I look?
~ Exceptionally ordinary.</font>

282
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,232
<font color="#696969">Brilliant.</font>

283
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,616
<font color="#696969">Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.</font>

284
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,184
<font color="#696969">Will you stop eating?</font>

285
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,687
<font color="#696969">Your best friend is missing!</font>

286
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,023
<font color="#696969">Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.</font>

287
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,402
<font color="#696969">He's covered in blood again.</font>

288
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,781
<font color="#696969">~ Why is it he's always covered in blood?
~ Looks like it's his own this time.</font>

289
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,075
<font color="#696969">Where have you been?</font>

290
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,786
<font color="#696969">~ What happened to your face?
~ Later.</font>

291
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,558
<font color="#696969">What've I missed?</font>

292
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,833
<font color="#696969">Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.</font>

293
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:59,587
<font color="#696969">Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?</font>

294
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,179
<font color="#696969">Very best of evenings to you all.</font>

295
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,326
<font color="#696969">Thanks.</font>

296
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:17,207
<font color="#696969">First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff....</font>

297
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,605
<font color="#696969">....Horace Slughorn.</font>

298
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,444
<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say....</font>

299
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:29,823
<font color="#696969">....has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.</font>

300
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,951
<font color="#696969">Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts....</font>

301
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,932
<font color="#696969">....will be taken by Professor Snape.</font>

302
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,809
<font color="#696969">Snape?</font>

303
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,420
<font color="#696969">Now, as you know....</font>

304
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:48,278
<font color="#696969">....each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.</font>

305
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,467
<font color="#696969">And you have the right to know why.</font>

306
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:54,846
<font color="#696969">Once there was a young man, who, like you....</font>

307
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,453
<font color="#696969">....sat in this very hall....</font>

308
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,458
<font color="#696969">....walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.</font>

309
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:07,462
<font color="#696969">He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.</font>

310
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,131
<font color="#696969">His name?</font>

311
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,946
<font color="#696969">Tom Riddle.</font>

312
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,827
<font color="#696969">Today, of course....</font>

313
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:22,685
<font color="#696969">....he's known all over the world by another name.</font>

314
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:29,045
<font color="#696969">Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight....</font>

315
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,547
<font color="#696969">....I'm reminded of a sobering fact.</font>

316
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,926
<font color="#696969">Every day, every hour....</font>

317
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,012
<font color="#696969">....this very minute, perhaps....</font>

318
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,495
<font color="#696969">....dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.</font>

319
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:49,689
<font color="#696969">But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.</font>

320
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,902
<font color="#696969">Just something to think about.</font>

321
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,717
<font color="#696969">Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.</font>

322
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,158
<font color="#696969">That was cheerful.</font>

323
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:11,167
<font color="#696969">History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.</font>

324
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:17,006
<font color="#696969">Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.</font>

325
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,177
<font color="#696969">Potter.</font>

326
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,513
<font color="#696969">Oh, this can't be good.</font>

327
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,205
<font color="#696969">Enjoying ourselves, are we?</font>

328
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:33,271
<font color="#696969">~ I had a free period this morning.
~ So I noticed.</font>

329
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,191
<font color="#696969">I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.</font>

330
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,110
<font color="#696969">Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?</font>

331
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,489
<font color="#696969">It was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.</font>

332
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,513
<font color="#696969">So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.</font>

333
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:51,309
<font color="#696969">However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students....</font>

334
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,290
<font color="#696969">....with "Exceeds Expectations."</font>

335
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,375
<font color="#696969">Brilliant. Um....</font>

336
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,086
<font color="#696969">~ Well, I'll head there straightaway.
~ Oh, good, good.</font>

337
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,091
<font color="#696969">Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.</font>

338
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,219
<font color="#696969">I don't wanna take Potions.</font>

339
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,138
<font color="#696969">This is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.</font>

340
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,266
<font color="#696969">Attention to detail
in the preparation....</font>

341
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,768
<font color="#696969">....is the prerequisite of all planning.</font>

342
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,688
<font color="#696969">Ah.</font>

343
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,754
<font color="#696969">Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.</font>

344
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,526
<font color="#696969">Ron Weasley, sir.</font>

345
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,550
<font color="#696969">But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.</font>

346
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,844
<font color="#696969">~ I'm gonna....
~ Nonsense, we'll sort you out.</font>

347
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,076
<font color="#696969">Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.</font>

348
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,787
<font color="#696969">I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.</font>

349
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,664
<font color="#696969">Get what you want from the cupboard.</font>

350
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:40,209
<font color="#696969">Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.</font>

351
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,275
<font color="#696969">Any ideas what these might be?</font>

352
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,341
<font color="#696969">~ Yes, Miss....?
~ Granger, sir.</font>

353
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:56,057
<font color="#696969">That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.</font>

354
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,976
<font color="#696969">And that would be Polyjuice Potion.</font>

355
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
<font color="#696969">It's terribly tricky to make.</font>

356
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,483
<font color="#696969">And this is Amortentia....</font>

357
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:09,090
<font color="#696969">....the most powerful
love potion in the world.</font>

358
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,781
<font color="#696969">It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.</font>

359
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,118
<font color="#696969">For example, I smell....</font>

360
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,914
<font color="#696969">....freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and....</font>

361
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,459
<font color="#696969">....spearmint toothpaste.</font>

362
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,255
<font color="#696969">Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.</font>

363
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:35,468
<font color="#696969">But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.</font>

364
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:42,350
<font color="#696969">And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.</font>

365
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,691
<font color="#696969">Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.</font>

366
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,776
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

367
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,487
<font color="#696969">What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen....</font>

368
00:34:55,695 --> 00:35:01,117
<font color="#696969">....is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.</font>

369
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,724
<font color="#696969">But it is more commonly referred to as....</font>

370
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:09,250
<font color="#696969">~ Liquid luck.
~ Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.</font>

371
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,690
<font color="#696969">Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.</font>

372
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:18,529
<font color="#696969">One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.</font>

373
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,013
<font color="#696969">At least until the effects wear off.</font>

374
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:27,704
<font color="#696969">So this is what I offer each of you today.</font>

375
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:32,709
<font color="#696969">One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains....</font>

376
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:37,505
<font color="#696969">....manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death....</font>

377
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:40,946
<font color="#696969">....the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.</font>

378
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,699
<font color="#696969">I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to 
brew a potion....</font>

379
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:48,244
<font color="#696969">....of sufficient quality to claim this prize.</font>

380
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,059
<font color="#696969">Nevertheless, good luck to you all.</font>

381
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,770
<font color="#696969">Let the brewing commence.</font>

382
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,409
<font color="#696969">How did you do that?</font>

383
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,120
<font color="#696969">You crush it. Don't cut it.</font>

384
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,727
<font color="#696969">No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.</font>

385
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,812
<font color="#696969">No, really.</font>

386
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,475
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard! It is perfect.</font>

387
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:24,167
<font color="#696969">So perfect I dare say
one drop would kill us all.</font>

388
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,380
<font color="#696969">So here we are, then, as promised.</font>

389
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,821
<font color="#696969">One vial of Felix Felicis.</font>

390
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,010
<font color="#696969">Congratulations.</font>

391
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,242
<font color="#696969">Use it well.</font>

392
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,583
<font color="#696969">Harry, you got my message. Come in.</font>

393
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,607
<font color="#696969">How are you?</font>

394
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,275
<font color="#696969">I'm fine, sir.</font>

395
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:14,735
<font color="#696969">Enjoying your classes?</font>

396
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:19,010
<font color="#696969">I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.</font>

397
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,033
<font color="#696969">I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.</font>

398
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,806
<font color="#696969">Do you?</font>

399
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:25,682
<font color="#696969">Definitely.</font>

400
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:30,479
<font color="#696969">What about your activities
outside the classroom?</font>

401
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,711
<font color="#696969">~ Sir?
~ Well, I notice you spend....</font>

402
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,526
<font color="#696969">....a great deal of time with Miss Granger.</font>

403
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,881
<font color="#696969">I can't help wondering....</font>

404
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,094
<font color="#696969">Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.</font>

405
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,222
<font color="#696969">Forgive me. I was merely being curious.</font>

406
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,246
<font color="#696969">But enough chitchat.</font>

407
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:53,000
<font color="#696969">You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.</font>

408
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,440
<font color="#696969">The answer lies here.</font>

409
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,568
<font color="#696969">What you are looking at are memories.</font>

410
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:03,634
<font color="#696969">In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort....</font>

411
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:06,241
<font color="#696969">....or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.</font>

412
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:13,122
<font color="#696969">This vial contains
the most particular memory....</font>

413
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,520
<font color="#696969">....of the day I first met him.</font>

414
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,587
<font color="#696969">I'd like you to see it, if you would.</font>

415
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,501
<font color="#696969">I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</font>

416
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:05,254
<font color="#696969">In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.</font>

417
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:09,216
<font color="#696969">There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.</font>

418
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,804
<font color="#696969">Tom, you have a visitor.</font>

419
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,993
<font color="#696969">How do you do, Tom?</font>

420
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,752
<font color="#696969">Don't.</font>

421
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,699
<font color="#696969">~ You're the doctor, aren't you?
~ No.</font>

422
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,889
<font color="#696969">I am a professor.</font>

423
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,391
<font color="#696969">I don't believe you.</font>

424
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,581
<font color="#696969">She wants me looked at.</font>

425
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,396
<font color="#696969">They think I'm different.</font>

426
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,064
<font color="#696969">Well, perhaps they're right.</font>

427
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,732
<font color="#696969">I'm not mad.</font>

428
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:52,173
<font color="#696969">Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.</font>

429
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,362
<font color="#696969">Hogwarts is a school.</font>

430
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,239
<font color="#696969">A school of magic.</font>

431
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,538
<font color="#696969">You can do things, can't you, Tom?</font>

432
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,291
<font color="#696969">Things other children can't.</font>

433
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,670
<font color="#696969">I can make things move
without touching them.</font>

434
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,154
<font color="#696969">I can make animals do what I want without training them.</font>

435
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:20,533
<font color="#696969">I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.</font>

436
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:23,139
<font color="#696969">I can make them hurt....</font>

437
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,224
<font color="#696969">....if I want.</font>

438
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,727
<font color="#696969">Who are you?</font>

439
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,021
<font color="#696969">Well, I'm like you, Tom.</font>

440
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,731
<font color="#696969">I'm different.</font>

441
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,130
<font color="#696969">Prove it.</font>

442
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,599
<font color="#696969">I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.</font>

443
00:41:56,295 --> 00:42:00,049
<font color="#696969">Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.</font>

444
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:05,887
<font color="#696969">At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.</font>

445
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:07,243
<font color="#696969">You understand me?</font>

446
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:13,811
<font color="#696969">I can speak to snakes too.</font>

447
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,835
<font color="#696969">They find me.</font>

448
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,754
<font color="#696969">Whisper things.</font>

449
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:23,091
<font color="#696969">Is that normal for someone like me?</font>

450
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:47,488
<font color="#696969">Did you know, sir? Then?</font>

451
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:53,223
<font color="#696969">Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.</font>

452
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,934
<font color="#696969">If I had, I....</font>

453
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,104
<font color="#696969">Over time, while here at Hogwarts....</font>

454
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,545
<font color="#696969">....Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.</font>

455
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,526
<font color="#696969">Can you guess
who that teacher might be?</font>

456
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,990
<font color="#696969">You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?</font>

457
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,180
<font color="#696969">No, I did not.</font>

458
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:18,142
<font color="#696969">You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.</font>

459
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,061
<font color="#696969">And he will not give it up easily.</font>

460
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,398
<font color="#696969">You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.</font>

461
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,857
<font color="#696969">I did.</font>

462
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,568
<font color="#696969">Do you want me to let him?</font>

463
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,279
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

464
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,192
<font color="#696969">All right. Um....</font>

465
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,425
<font color="#696969">This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills....</font>

466
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,718
<font color="#696969">....just to assess your strengths.</font>

467
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,429
<font color="#696969">Quiet! Please!</font>

468
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:06,785
<font color="#696969">Shut it!</font>

469
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,353
<font color="#696969">Thanks. All right. Um....</font>

470
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,647
<font color="#696969">Just because you
made the team last year....</font>

471
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:18,775
<font color="#696969">....does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?</font>

472
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,529
<font color="#696969">Good.</font>

473
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,476
<font color="#696969">No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?</font>

474
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,249
<font color="#696969">Hard feelings?</font>

475
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:39,002
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.</font>

476
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,817
<font color="#696969">Really? Strapping guy like you?</font>

477
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,528
<font color="#696969">You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?</font>

478
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,135
<font color="#696969">Keepers need to be quick, agile.</font>

479
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,263
<font color="#696969">Oh, I like my chances.</font>

480
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,225
<font color="#696969">Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?</font>

481
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,604
<font color="#696969">Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?</font>

482
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,575
<font color="#696969">Come on, Weasley!</font>

483
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,452
<font color="#696969">~ Come on, Ron!
~ Go on, Weasley!</font>

484
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,935
<font color="#696969">~ Go on, Weasley!
~ Yeah, Ron!</font>

485
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,291
<font color="#696969">Go on, Cormac!</font>

486
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,954
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron!</font>

487
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,859
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron.</font>

488
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,465
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron.</font>

489
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:10,546
<font color="#696969">Confundus.</font>

490
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,000
<font color="#696969">Isn't he brilliant?</font>

491
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:35,256
<font color="#696969">I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.</font>

492
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,384
<font color="#696969">I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.</font>

493
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,825
<font color="#696969">He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.</font>

494
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,953
<font color="#696969">He's vile.</font>

495
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,147
<font color="#696969">Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?</font>

496
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:54,336
<font color="#696969">No, I haven't.</font>

497
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,673
<font color="#696969">And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.</font>

498
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:00,279
<font color="#696969">Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.</font>

499
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:04,658
<font color="#696969">He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.</font>

500
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,057
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

501
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,602
<font color="#696969">I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.</font>

502
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,270
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

503
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,085
<font color="#696969">Why not?</font>

504
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,274
<font color="#696969">The binding is fragile.</font>

505
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,985
<font color="#696969">~ The binding is fragile?
~ Yeah.</font>

506
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,824
<font color="#696969">~ Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
~ Who?</font>

507
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,786
<font color="#696969">That's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."</font>

508
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,430
<font color="#696969">For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it....</font>

509
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,933
<font color="#696969">....yet you have no desire to find out who he is?</font>

510
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,478
<font color="#696969">I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.</font>

511
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:57,729
<font color="#696969">Well, it's true.</font>

512
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,691
<font color="#696969">I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.</font>

513
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,776
<font color="#696969">It's just like being with Hermione.</font>

514
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,634
<font color="#696969">Well, I was curious, so I went to....</font>

515
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,345
<font color="#696969">~ The library.
~ The library. And?</font>

516
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,847
<font color="#696969">And nothing.</font>

517
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:16,079
<font color="#696969">I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.</font>

518
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,373
<font color="#696969">~ There we go. That settles it, then.
~ Filius!</font>

519
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,875
<font color="#696969">I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!</font>

520
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:25,671
<font color="#696969">No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.</font>

521
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,614
<font color="#696969">Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?</font>

522
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,221
<font color="#696969">A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.</font>

523
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:37,974
<font color="#696969">We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge....</font>

524
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,581
<font color="#696969">No, not there. Over here.</font>

525
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,771
<font color="#696969">No, sit beside me.</font>

526
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,794
<font color="#696969">Okay.</font>

527
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,609
<font color="#696969">Something to drink?</font>

528
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,320
<font color="#696969">Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.</font>

529
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:05,083
<font color="#696969">Oh, bloody hell.</font>

530
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,879
<font color="#696969">Slick git.</font>

531
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:12,903
<font color="#696969">Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.</font>

532
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:16,969
<font color="#696969">And snogging.</font>

533
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:20,618
<font color="#696969">~ I'd like to leave.
~ What?</font>

534
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:22,391
<font color="#696969">You can't be serious.</font>

535
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:24,893
<font color="#696969">~ That happens to be my sister.
~ So?</font>

536
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:28,959
<font color="#696969">What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her 
to leave?</font>

537
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:32,713
<font color="#696969">~ Hey, my boy!
~ Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.</font>

538
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,902
<font color="#696969">And you, and you.</font>

539
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,883
<font color="#696969">So, what brings you here?</font>

540
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:41,784
<font color="#696969">The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.</font>

541
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:45,329
<font color="#696969">I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.</font>

542
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,874
<font color="#696969">All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days....</font>

543
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:52,419
<font color="#696969">....I used to throw together the occasional supper party....</font>

544
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,817
<font color="#696969">....for the select student or two.</font>

545
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,883
<font color="#696969">~ Would you be game?
~ I'd consider it an honor, sir.</font>

546
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:02,532
<font color="#696969">You would be welcome too, Granger.</font>

547
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:08,058
<font color="#696969">~ I'd be delighted, sir.
~ Splendid. Look for my owl.</font>

548
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:10,873
<font color="#696969">Good to see you, Wallenby.</font>

549
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,546
<font color="#696969">What are you playing at?</font>

550
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,613
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.</font>

551
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,802
<font color="#696969">~ Get to know him?
~ I don't know.</font>

552
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:27,660
<font color="#696969">It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.</font>

553
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,375
<font color="#696969">Got a little bit....</font>

554
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:48,200
<font color="#696969">Katie, you don't know what it could be.</font>

555
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,764
<font color="#696969">~ Harry.
~ What?</font>

556
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:53,517
<font color="#696969">Did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?</font>

557
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,020
<font color="#696969">As if.</font>

558
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:05,820
<font color="#696969">I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.</font>

559
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,009
<font color="#696969">Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.</font>

560
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:47,317
<font color="#696969">Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?</font>

561
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,374
<font color="#696969">You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession....</font>

562
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:06,085
<font color="#696969">....when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?</font>

563
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,274
<font color="#696969">It's like I said.</font>

564
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:13,383
<font color="#696969">She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.</font>

565
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,345
<font color="#696969">She said it was important
that she deliver it.</font>

566
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,724
<font color="#696969">~ Did she say to whom?
~ To Professor Dumbledore.</font>

567
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,644
<font color="#696969">Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.</font>

568
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,861
<font color="#696969">Why is it when something happens it is always you three?</font>

569
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:40,387
<font color="#696969">Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.</font>

570
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,577
<font color="#696969">Oh, Severus.</font>

571
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,084
<font color="#696969">What do you think?</font>

572
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:56,861
<font color="#696969">I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.</font>

573
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,259
<font color="#696969">She was cursed, wasn't she?</font>

574
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:02,074
<font color="#696969">I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.</font>

575
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,141
<font color="#696969">If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.</font>

576
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,226
<font color="#696969">Yes, she was cursed.</font>

577
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,728
<font color="#696969">It was Malfoy.</font>

578
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:16,463
<font color="#696969">That is a very serious accusation, Potter.</font>

579
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,131
<font color="#696969">Indeed.</font>

580
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:22,406
<font color="#696969">~ Your evidence?
~ I just know.</font>

581
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,117
<font color="#696969">You just....</font>

582
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,723
<font color="#696969">....know.</font>

583
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,728
<font color="#696969">You astonish with your gifts, Potter.</font>

584
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:36,794
<font color="#696969">Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.</font>

585
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:43,154
<font color="#696969">How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.</font>

586
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:51,287
<font color="#696969">I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.</font>

587
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:04,737
<font color="#696969">What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?</font>

588
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,490
<font color="#696969">Well, what does she see in him?</font>

589
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,784
<font color="#696969">Dean? He's brilliant.</font>

590
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,808
<font color="#696969">You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.</font>

591
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:17,770
<font color="#696969">Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?</font>

592
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:22,462
<font color="#696969">Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.</font>

593
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,651
<font color="#696969">I suppose.</font>

594
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,134
<font color="#696969">~ So, what is it he sees in her?
~ I don't know.</font>

595
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,262
<font color="#696969">She's smart, funny.</font>

596
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,286
<font color="#696969">~ Attractive.
~ Attractive?</font>

597
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,395
<font color="#696969">~ You know, she's got nice skin.
~ Skin?</font>

598
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,001
<font color="#696969">Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?</font>

599
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,693
<font color="#696969">Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.</font>

600
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,802
<font color="#696969">Hermione's got nice skin.</font>

601
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:56,243
<font color="#696969">Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.</font>

602
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,371
<font color="#696969">I've never really thought about it.</font>

603
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,603
<font color="#696969">But, I suppose, yeah.</font>

604
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,793
<font color="#696969">Very nice.</font>

605
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,612
<font color="#696969">~ I think I'll be going to sleep now.
~ Right. Yeah.</font>

606
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:26,375
<font color="#696969">So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?</font>

607
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,086
<font color="#696969">Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him....</font>

608
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,484
<font color="#696969">....and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.</font>

609
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,612
<font color="#696969">Well, be sure to give them both my best.</font>

610
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,697
<font color="#696969">What about your uncle, Belby?</font>

611
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,347
<font color="#696969">For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.</font>

612
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:43,370
<font color="#696969">~ Is he working on anything new?
~ Don't know.</font>

613
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:47,541
<font color="#696969">Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.</font>

614
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:51,086
<font color="#696969">Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.</font>

615
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,299
<font color="#696969">What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the 
Muggle world?</font>

616
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,905
<font color="#696969">My parents are dentists.</font>

617
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:04,744
<font color="#696969">They tend to people's teeth.</font>

618
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:09,645
<font color="#696969">Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?</font>

619
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,104
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

620
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:17,569
<font color="#696969">Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.</font>

621
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,028
<font color="#696969">He needed 10 stitches.</font>

622
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,933
<font color="#696969">Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.</font>

623
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:36,023
<font color="#696969">Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.</font>

624
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:38,943
<font color="#696969">Sorry. I'm not usually late.</font>

625
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:47,180
<font color="#696969">No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.</font>

626
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,146
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

627
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,919
<font color="#696969">Nothing.</font>

628
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,928
<font color="#696969">Goodbye. Bye-bye.</font>

629
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:14,497
<font color="#696969">~ Potter.
~ I'm sorry, sir.</font>

630
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,312
<font color="#696969">I was just admiring your hourglass.</font>

631
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,127
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

632
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,733
<font color="#696969">A most intriguing object.</font>

633
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,634
<font color="#696969">The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.</font>

634
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:31,179
<font color="#696969">If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.</font>

635
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,577
<font color="#696969">~ If it is not....
~ I think I'll be going.</font>

636
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:37,122
<font color="#696969">Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.</font>

637
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,520
<font color="#696969">As to some of your classmates....</font>

638
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,065
<font color="#696969">....well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.</font>

639
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,733
<font color="#696969">The shelf, sir?</font>

640
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,008
<font color="#696969">Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.</font>

641
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,970
<font color="#696969">But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?</font>

642
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,515
<font color="#696969">Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?</font>

643
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:02,666
<font color="#696969">You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.</font>

644
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:07,254
<font color="#696969">Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.</font>

645
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,922
<font color="#696969">What was he like?</font>

646
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:15,074
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.</font>

647
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,576
<font color="#696969">He killed my parents.</font>

648
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,538
<font color="#696969">Of course.</font>

649
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,979
<font color="#696969">It's only natural
you should want to know more.</font>

650
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,879
<font color="#696969">But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.</font>

651
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:33,111
<font color="#696969">When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet....</font>

652
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:37,490
<font color="#696969">....albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.</font>

653
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,367
<font color="#696969">Not unlike others I've known.</font>

654
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,078
<font color="#696969">Not unlike yourself, in fact.</font>

655
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,519
<font color="#696969">If the monster existed....</font>

656
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,334
<font color="#696969">....it was buried deep within.</font>

657
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,101
<font color="#696969">Good luck, eh, Ron.</font>

658
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,959
<font color="#696969">~ Nice hat!
~ Ron, you're a loser.</font>

659
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:14,191
<font color="#696969">I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?</font>

660
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,694
<font color="#696969">~ Looking good, Ron.
~ Loser!</font>

661
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,447
<font color="#696969">What's he wearing?</font>

662
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:30,873
<font color="#696969">So how was it, then?</font>

663
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,418
<font color="#696969">~ How was what?
~ Your dinner party?</font>

664
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,295
<font color="#696969">Pretty boring, actually.</font>

665
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,423
<font color="#696969">Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.</font>

666
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:45,575
<font color="#696969">Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.</font>

667
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,243
<font color="#696969">And we're meant to bring someone.</font>

668
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,101
<font color="#696969">I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, 
isn't he?</font>

669
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,124
<font color="#696969">~ Actually, I was going to ask you.
~ Really?</font>

670
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,025
<font color="#696969">Good luck today, Ron.</font>

671
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:02,153
<font color="#696969">I know you'll be brilliant.</font>

672
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:08,930
<font color="#696969">I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.</font>

673
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:10,598
<font color="#696969">Have it your way.</font>

674
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,309
<font color="#696969">~ Juice?
~ Sure.</font>

675
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,185
<font color="#696969">Hello, everyone.</font>

676
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:18,522
<font color="#696969">You look dreadful, Ron.</font>

677
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:21,024
<font color="#696969">Is that why you put something in his cup?</font>

678
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:24,882
<font color="#696969">Is it a tonic?</font>

679
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,991
<font color="#696969">Liquid luck.</font>

680
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,015
<font color="#696969">Don't drink it, Ron.</font>

681
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,962
<font color="#696969">~ You could be expelled for that.
~ I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

682
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:48,863
<font color="#696969">Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.</font>

683
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,512
<font color="#696969">Yes!</font>

684
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,848
<font color="#696969">Go on, Ron! Do it!</font>

685
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,027
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

686
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:55,904
<font color="#696969">Yes!</font>

687
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,553
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

688
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:04,871
<font color="#696969">Whoo!</font>

689
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:08,312
<font color="#696969">Yes. Whoo!</font>

690
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:14,880
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

691
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:20,823
<font color="#696969">You really shouldn't have done it.</font>

692
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:26,036
<font color="#696969">I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.</font>

693
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,667
<font color="#696969">That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.</font>

694
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,150
<font color="#696969">You didn't put it in.</font>

695
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,695
<font color="#696969">Ron only thought you did.</font>

696
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,784
<font color="#696969">Charms spell. I'm just practicing.</font>

697
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,519
<font color="#696969">Well, they're really good.</font>

698
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,026
<font color="#696969">How does it feel, Harry?</font>

699
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,073
<font color="#696969">When you see Dean with Ginny?</font>

700
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,641
<font color="#696969">I know.</font>

701
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:59,874
<font color="#696969">I see the way you look at her.</font>

702
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,167
<font color="#696969">You're my best friend.</font>

703
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,115
<font color="#696969">Oops.</font>

704
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,764
<font color="#696969">I think this room's taken.</font>

705
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:19,997
<font color="#696969">What's with the birds?</font>

706
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,105
<font color="#696969">Oppugno.</font>

707
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,821
<font color="#696969">It feels like this.</font>

708
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,569
<font color="#696969">Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.</font>

709
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:42,782
<font color="#696969">What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.</font>

710
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,346
<font color="#696969">It's chemical.</font>

711
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:48,933
<font color="#696969">Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.</font>

712
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,853
<font color="#696969">He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.</font>

713
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,459
<font color="#696969">I really couldn't care less.</font>

714
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:58,526
<font color="#696969">Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?</font>

715
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,194
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

716
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:04,782
<font color="#696969">Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.</font>

717
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,137
<font color="#696969">Have you?</font>

718
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:08,326
<font color="#696969">Yes. Why?</font>

719
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:12,080
<font color="#696969">I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to....</font>

720
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,478
<font color="#696969">....we should go together, as friends.</font>

721
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:16,251
<font color="#696969">Why didn't I think of that?</font>

722
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:18,023
<font color="#696969">Who are you going with?</font>

723
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:20,004
<font color="#696969">Um, it's a surprise.</font>

724
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:24,383
<font color="#696969">Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.</font>

725
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,885
<font color="#696969">See that girl over there?</font>

726
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:33,141
<font color="#696969">That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.</font>

727
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,809
<font color="#696969">Really?</font>

728
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:39,293
<font color="#696969">Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.</font>

729
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,170
<font color="#696969">But I am the Chosen One.</font>

730
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:44,193
<font color="#696969">Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.</font>

731
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:47,634
<font color="#696969">I'll ask someone I like.</font>

732
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,032
<font color="#696969">Someone cool.</font>

733
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,752
<font color="#696969">I've never been to this part of the castle.</font>

734
01:08:02,961 --> 01:08:06,193
<font color="#696969">At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.</font>

735
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,904
<font color="#696969">That's why I wear shoes to bed.</font>

736
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,102
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

737
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,325
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

738
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,599
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

739
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,656
<font color="#696969">Drink?</font>

740
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,846
<font color="#696969">Neville.</font>

741
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:22,514
<font color="#696969">I didn't get into the Slug Club.</font>

742
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,746
<font color="#696969">It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.</font>

743
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,770
<font color="#696969">~ Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
~ Okay.</font>

744
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:42,115
<font color="#696969">Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?</font>

745
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:47,641
<font color="#696969">I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.</font>

746
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:50,769
<font color="#696969">Cormac? That's who you invited?</font>

747
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,480
<font color="#696969">I thought it would annoy Ron the most.</font>

748
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,295
<font color="#696969">Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.</font>

749
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:59,527
<font color="#696969">He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.</font>

750
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,821
<font color="#696969">~ Dragon tartare?
~ No, I'm fine. Thank you.</font>

751
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,636
<font color="#696969">Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.</font>

752
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,617
<font color="#696969">On second thoughts....</font>

753
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,807
<font color="#696969">Might keep Cormac at bay.</font>

754
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,039
<font color="#696969">Oh, God, here he comes.</font>

755
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:17,461
<font color="#696969">I think she just went to powder her nose.</font>

756
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:19,755
<font color="#696969">Slippery little minx, your friend.</font>

757
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:22,674
<font color="#696969">Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?</font>

758
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:27,679
<font color="#696969">What is this I'm eating, by the way?</font>

759
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,494
<font color="#696969">Dragon balls.</font>

760
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,778
<font color="#696969">You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.</font>

761
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:48,844
<font color="#696969">Not so quick, Potter.</font>

762
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:53,536
<font color="#696969">Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date....</font>

763
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:57,602
<font color="#696969">Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.</font>

764
01:10:57,811 --> 01:11:00,000
<font color="#696969">Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.</font>

765
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,920
<font color="#696969">~ A message?
~ From Professor Dumbledore.</font>

766
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,777
<font color="#696969">He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.</font>

767
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:08,446
<font color="#696969">You see....</font>

768
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:14,180
<font color="#696969">....he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.</font>

769
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,848
<font color="#696969">Traveling where?</font>

770
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,858
<font color="#696969">Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!</font>

771
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,777
<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn, sir.</font>

772
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:33,260
<font color="#696969">I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.</font>

773
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,450
<font color="#696969">He claims to have been
invited to your party.</font>

774
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,891
<font color="#696969">Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?</font>

775
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:43,270
<font color="#696969">I'll escort him out.</font>

776
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:49,734
<font color="#696969">Certainly, professor.</font>

777
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,615
<font color="#696969">All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.</font>

778
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,601
<font color="#696969">Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?</font>

779
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,895
<font color="#696969">I swore to protect you.</font>

780
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:09,440
<font color="#696969">I made the Unbreakable Vow.</font>

781
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,734
<font color="#696969">I don't need protection.</font>

782
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:16,113
<font color="#696969">I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.</font>

783
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:20,492
<font color="#696969">~ And I won't fail him.
~ You're afraid, Draco.</font>

784
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:25,079
<font color="#696969">You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.</font>

785
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:26,643
<font color="#696969">No!</font>

786
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,397
<font color="#696969">I was chosen. This is my moment.</font>

787
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,472
<font color="#696969">"Unbreakable Vow."</font>

788
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,245
<font color="#696969">You're sure that's what Snape said?</font>

789
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:48,643
<font color="#696969">Positive. Why?</font>

790
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:52,397
<font color="#696969">Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.</font>

791
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,837
<font color="#696969">I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.</font>

792
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:58,131
<font color="#696969">You don't understand.</font>

793
01:12:58,757 --> 01:12:59,799
<font color="#696969">Oh, bloody hell.</font>

794
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:29,514
<font color="#696969">I miss you.</font>

795
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:32,851
<font color="#696969">Lovely.</font>

796
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,292
<font color="#696969">All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.</font>

797
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,690
<font color="#696969">I'll take your word for it.</font>

798
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:53,704
<font color="#696969">So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?</font>

799
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:55,997
<font color="#696969">You die.</font>

800
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,462
<font color="#696969">Wait, the pudding's still here.</font>

801
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:07,049
<font color="#696969">Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?</font>

802
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:08,300
<font color="#696969">I know it sounds mad.</font>

803
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,950
<font color="#696969">Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help....</font>

804
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,556
<font color="#696969">....so he could find out
what he was up to?</font>

805
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:17,788
<font color="#696969">~ That's not what it sounded like.
~ Perhaps Harry's right.</font>

806
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,978
<font color="#696969">To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's....</font>

807
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,627
<font color="#696969">It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.</font>

808
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:27,902
<font color="#696969">~ Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
~ Dumbledore can make mistakes.</font>

809
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,153
<font color="#696969">You're blinded by hatred.</font>

810
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:31,447
<font color="#696969">~ I'm not.
~ Yes, you are.</font>

811
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,139
<font color="#696969">People are disappearing, Harry, daily.</font>

812
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,328
<font color="#696969">We place our trust
in a handful of people.</font>

813
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:41,456
<font color="#696969">If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.</font>

814
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,418
<font color="#696969">Open up, you.</font>

815
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:10,754
<font color="#696969">Don't you trust me?</font>

816
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,053
<font color="#696969">It's good.</font>

817
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,806
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I'll just.... Get.... Yeah.</font>

818
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:31,399
<font color="#696969">~ Pie?
~ Not for me, no.</font>

819
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,849
<font color="#696969">You'll have to forgive Remus.</font>

820
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,976
<font color="#696969">It takes its toll, his condition.</font>

821
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,896
<font color="#696969">Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?</font>

822
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,607
<font color="#696969">We're being followed, all of us.</font>

823
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,318
<font color="#696969">Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.</font>

824
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,237
<font color="#696969">It's not been easy.</font>

825
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:02,573
<font color="#696969">Did you get my owl?</font>

826
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,867
<font color="#696969">Yes, I did.</font>

827
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,455
<font color="#696969">If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry....</font>

828
01:16:09,559 --> 01:16:12,061
<font color="#696969">....but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.</font>

829
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,294
<font color="#696969">As for Draco Malfoy....</font>

830
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,066
<font color="#696969">....I know a bit more.</font>

831
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:20,715
<font color="#696969">~ Go on.
~ I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.</font>

832
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,218
<font color="#696969">I think, from what you described....</font>

833
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:25,094
<font color="#696969">....what you and Ron saw in summer....</font>

834
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,744
<font color="#696969">....the object
that Draco is so interested in....</font>

835
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,412
<font color="#696969">....is a vanishing cabinet.</font>

836
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:32,601
<font color="#696969">A vanishing cabinet?</font>

837
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:36,772
<font color="#696969">They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.</font>

838
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,900
<font color="#696969">You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking....</font>

839
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:44,800
<font color="#696969">....one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.</font>

840
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,198
<font color="#696969">They can transport you anywhere.</font>

841
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,743
<font color="#696969">Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.</font>

842
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,767
<font color="#696969">What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?</font>

843
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,122
<font color="#696969">Nothing.</font>

844
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,625
<font color="#696969">It's still there.</font>

845
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:10,449
<font color="#696969">It was delicious, Molly, really.</font>

846
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:11,909
<font color="#696969">Are you sure you won't stay?</font>

847
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:16,496
<font color="#696969">No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.</font>

848
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:17,643
<font color="#696969">Remus?</font>

849
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,174
<font color="#696969">Sweetheart.</font>

850
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:38,183
<font color="#696969">Has Ron gone to bed?</font>

851
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,207
<font color="#696969">Um.... Not yet. No.</font>

852
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:44,335
<font color="#696969">Shoelace.</font>

853
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,827
<font color="#696969">Merry Christmas, Harry.</font>

854
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:01,747
<font color="#696969">Merry Christmas.</font>

855
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:21,348
<font color="#696969">~ Harry, no!
~ Remus!</font>

856
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,609
<font color="#696969">Ginny!</font>

857
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:40,429
<font color="#696969">I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</font>

858
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,827
<font color="#696969">You coming to get me?</font>

859
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,310
<font color="#696969">Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?</font>

860
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:18,381
<font color="#696969">Harry?</font>

861
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,565
<font color="#696969">Stupefy!</font>

862
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,171
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

863
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,872
<font color="#696969">Ginny!</font>

864
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:47,943
<font color="#696969">Molly.</font>

865
01:21:10,985 --> 01:21:12,653
<font color="#696969">It's easy for them to get to you.</font>

866
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:16,928
<font color="#696969">You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.</font>

867
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,639
<font color="#696969">I know who I am, Hermione, all right?</font>

868
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:21,829
<font color="#696969">Sorry.</font>

869
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,833
<font color="#696969">Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.</font>

870
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,127
<font color="#696969">That's my Won-Won.</font>

871
01:21:31,212 --> 01:21:33,610
<font color="#696969">Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.</font>

872
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:53,525
<font color="#696969">I'd like to know
where you get your information.</font>

873
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,757
<font color="#696969">More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</font>

874
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,951
<font color="#696969">Sir....</font>

875
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:07,183
<font color="#696969">....is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?</font>

876
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:10,207
<font color="#696969">Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?</font>

877
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:14,586
<font color="#696969">By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.</font>

878
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:17,505
<font color="#696969">But how did you know?</font>

879
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,842
<font color="#696969">Intuition.</font>

880
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:26,785
<font color="#696969">Gracious. Is it that time already?</font>

881
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:30,643
<font color="#696969">Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.</font>

882
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:38,567
<font color="#696969">Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.</font>

883
01:22:40,548 --> 01:22:42,529
<font color="#696969">~ Is something on your mind, Tom?
~ Yes, sir.</font>

884
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:46,699
<font color="#696969">You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.</font>

885
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:52,642
<font color="#696969">The other professors,
well, they're not like you.</font>

886
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:56,083
<font color="#696969">They might misunderstand.</font>

887
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:57,856
<font color="#696969">Go on.</font>

888
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,879
<font color="#696969">I was in the library the other night....</font>

889
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,694
<font color="#696969">....in the Restricted Section....</font>

890
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:07,969
<font color="#696969">....and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.</font>

891
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:12,348
<font color="#696969">And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.</font>

892
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:15,372
<font color="#696969">It's called, as I understand it....</font>

893
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,438
<font color="#696969">I beg your pardon?</font>

894
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:23,192
<font color="#696969">I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!</font>

895
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,196
<font color="#696969">Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!</font>

896
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,263
<font color="#696969">Confused?</font>

897
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,452
<font color="#696969">I'd be surprised if you weren't.</font>

898
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,101
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't understand.
What happened?</font>

899
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,959
<font color="#696969">This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.</font>

900
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,044
<font color="#696969">It is also a lie.</font>

901
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,755
<font color="#696969">This memory has been tampered with....</font>

902
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:51,343
<font color="#696969">....by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.</font>

903
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:53,949
<font color="#696969">But why would he tamper
with his own memory?</font>

904
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,973
<font color="#696969">~ I suspect he's ashamed of it.
~ Why?</font>

905
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:58,641
<font color="#696969">Why, indeed?</font>

906
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:02,812
<font color="#696969">I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.</font>

907
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,565
<font color="#696969">Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory....</font>

908
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:08,338
<font color="#696969">....any way you can.</font>

909
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:10,423
<font color="#696969">I don't know him that well, sir.</font>

910
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:17,826
<font color="#696969">This memory is everything.</font>

911
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:20,328
<font color="#696969">Without it, we are blind.</font>

912
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,499
<font color="#696969">Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.</font>

913
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,356
<font color="#696969">You have no choice.</font>

914
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:31,589
<font color="#696969">You must not fail.</font>

915
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,015
<font color="#696969">So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself....</font>

916
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,579
<font color="#696969">....with the chapter on antidotes.</font>

917
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,541
<font color="#696969">I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.</font>

918
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,147
<font color="#696969">Alys, don't forget your rat tail.</font>

919
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,427
<font color="#696969">Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.</font>

920
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,512
<font color="#696969">To what do I owe this pleasure?</font>

921
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,744
<font color="#696969">Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.</font>

922
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,247
<font color="#696969">Ask away, dear boy, ask away.</font>

923
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:10,375
<font color="#696969">The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section....</font>

924
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:14,232
<font color="#696969">....and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece 
of magic.</font>

925
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:18,194
<font color="#696969">Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?</font>

926
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:21,739
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.</font>

927
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:26,223
<font color="#696969">It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?</font>

928
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:29,559
<font color="#696969">I'm Potions Master, Harry.</font>

929
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:32,583
<font color="#696969">I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.</font>

930
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,668
<font color="#696969">Yes. Um....</font>

931
01:25:34,877 --> 01:25:37,275
<font color="#696969">He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.</font>

932
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:39,256
<font color="#696969">What I mean to say is....</font>

933
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,862
<font color="#696969">....well, he's not like you.</font>

934
01:25:42,592 --> 01:25:44,365
<font color="#696969">He might misunderstand.</font>

935
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,578
<font color="#696969">Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.</font>

936
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:53,748
<font color="#696969">And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.</font>

937
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:56,042
<font color="#696969">I suggest you do the same.</font>

938
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:59,379
<font color="#696969">Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?</font>

939
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:09,388
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?</font>

940
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:13,037
<font color="#696969">Didn't he?</font>

941
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,691
<font color="#696969">Yes?</font>

942
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:24,193
<font color="#696969">Oh, it's you, Potter.</font>

943
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:26,800
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.</font>

944
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:43,378
<font color="#696969">It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.</font>

945
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,776
<font color="#696969">Divine.</font>

946
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,800
<font color="#696969">Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?</font>

947
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:53,491
<font color="#696969">It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.</font>

948
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,141
<font color="#696969">~ Or 20.
~ I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.</font>

949
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:59,330
<font color="#696969">Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.</font>

950
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:01,832
<font color="#696969">She could never annoy me.</font>

951
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:05,169
<font color="#696969">I think I love her.</font>

952
01:27:08,714 --> 01:27:11,008
<font color="#696969">Well, brilliant.</font>

953
01:27:14,865 --> 01:27:16,534
<font color="#696969">Do you think she knows I exist?</font>

954
01:27:16,638 --> 01:27:19,140
<font color="#696969">I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.</font>

955
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,268
<font color="#696969">Snogging? Who are you talking about?</font>

956
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:24,458
<font color="#696969">Who are you talking about?</font>

957
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,837
<font color="#696969">Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.</font>

958
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,505
<font color="#696969">Okay, very funny.</font>

959
01:27:33,633 --> 01:27:37,282
<font color="#696969">~ What was that for?
~ It's no joke! I'm in love with her!</font>

960
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:40,306
<font color="#696969">Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?</font>

961
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,268
<font color="#696969">No. Can you introduce me?</font>

962
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:10,751
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.</font>

963
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:25,139
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.</font>

964
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:27,433
<font color="#696969">Where's Romilda?</font>

965
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:29,518
<font color="#696969">What's the matter with Wenby?</font>

966
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,916
<font color="#696969">Very powerful love potion.</font>

967
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,419
<font color="#696969">Very well. Better bring him in.</font>

968
01:28:34,627 --> 01:28:37,859
<font color="#696969">I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.</font>

969
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:40,987
<font color="#696969">Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.</font>

970
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,219
<font color="#696969">Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?</font>

971
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:46,096
<font color="#696969">Perhaps you're right.</font>

972
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,001
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.</font>

973
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:00,589
<font color="#696969">Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?</font>

974
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:03,612
<font color="#696969">I expect you're tired of it after all these years.</font>

975
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:06,428
<font color="#696969">All the questions about Voldemort.</font>

976
01:29:06,532 --> 01:29:08,409
<font color="#696969">Don't use that name.</font>

977
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,209
<font color="#696969">There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.</font>

978
01:29:18,418 --> 01:29:21,441
<font color="#696969">~ What's this?
~ Tonic for the nerves.</font>

979
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,332
<font color="#696969">~ What happened to me?
~ Love potion.</font>

980
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:40,626
<font color="#696969">A bloody strong one at that.</font>

981
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:44,797
<font color="#696969">~ I feel really bad.
~ You need a pick-me-up.</font>

982
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,654
<font color="#696969">Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.</font>

983
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:53,138
<font color="#696969">I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances....</font>

984
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,100
<font color="#696969">Here we are, Potter.</font>

985
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:58,768
<font color="#696969">To life!</font>

986
01:30:03,668 --> 01:30:04,607
<font color="#696969">Ron.</font>

987
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:10,550
<font color="#696969">Ron. Professor, do something.</font>

988
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,261
<font color="#696969">I don't understand.</font>

989
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:31,507
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron, breathe.</font>

990
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:56,530
<font color="#696969">These girls, they're gonna kill me.</font>

991
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:10,918
<font color="#696969">Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.</font>

992
01:31:11,127 --> 01:31:13,421
<font color="#696969">You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.</font>

993
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,070
<font color="#696969">Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.</font>

994
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:19,989
<font color="#696969">I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.</font>

995
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:24,160
<font color="#696969">The question is,
why were they necessary?</font>

996
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:26,037
<font color="#696969">Why, indeed?</font>

997
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:28,226
<font color="#696969">This appears to be a gift, Horace.</font>

998
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:31,354
<font color="#696969">You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?</font>

999
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:35,525
<font color="#696969">Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry....</font>

1000
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,131
<font color="#696969">....when not polluted with poison.</font>

1001
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,468
<font color="#696969">Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.</font>

1002
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:43,032
<font color="#696969">To whom, I might ask?</font>

1003
01:31:44,804 --> 01:31:46,994
<font color="#696969">To you, Headmaster.</font>

1004
01:31:49,392 --> 01:31:50,434
<font color="#696969">Where is he?</font>

1005
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:54,709
<font color="#696969">Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?</font>

1006
01:31:57,733 --> 01:31:59,401
<font color="#696969">What's she doing here?</font>

1007
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,799
<font color="#696969">I might ask you the same question.</font>

1008
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:04,301
<font color="#696969">I happen to be his girlfriend.</font>

1009
01:32:04,406 --> 01:32:07,221
<font color="#696969">I happen to be his friend.</font>

1010
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:11,600
<font color="#696969">Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.</font>

1011
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,249
<font color="#696969">I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.</font>

1012
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:19,107
<font color="#696969">He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!</font>

1013
01:32:19,315 --> 01:32:22,130
<font color="#696969">And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.</font>

1014
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:28,803
<font color="#696969">Ah. See? He senses my presence.</font>

1015
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:32,244
<font color="#696969">Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.</font>

1016
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:34,746
<font color="#696969">I'm here.</font>

1017
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,817
<font color="#696969">Uh....Hermione....</font>

1018
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:49,865
<font color="#696969">Hermione.</font>

1019
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,888
<font color="#696969">Hermione.</font>

1020
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:04,357
<font color="#696969">Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.</font>

1021
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,068
<font color="#696969">Well, come away, everybody.</font>

1022
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:09,883
<font color="#696969">Mr. Weasley is well tended.</font>

1023
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,660
<font color="#696969">About time, don't you think?</font>

1024
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:20,935
<font color="#696969">Thank you.</font>

1025
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:25,627
<font color="#696969">Oh, shut up.</font>

1026
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:41,795
<font color="#696969">Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.</font>

1027
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:48,885
<font color="#696969">Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.</font>

1028
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,534
<font color="#696969">Um, well....</font>

1029
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:55,767
<font color="#696969">....she came to visit you
in the hospital.</font>

1030
01:35:56,601 --> 01:35:58,999
<font color="#696969">And you talked.</font>

1031
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:04,733
<font color="#696969">I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.</font>

1032
01:36:04,838 --> 01:36:08,174
<font color="#696969">Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.</font>

1033
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,676
<font color="#696969">It's just she seems a bit put out.</font>

1034
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,686
<font color="#696969">Yes, she does, doesn't she?</font>

1035
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:27,358
<font color="#696969">You say you don't remember
anything from that night?</font>

1036
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:30,486
<font color="#696969">Anything at all?</font>

1037
01:36:30,695 --> 01:36:32,467
<font color="#696969">There is something.</font>

1038
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:40,496
<font color="#696969">But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?</font>

1039
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:45,188
<font color="#696969">Right. Boggled.</font>

1040
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:53,737
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1041
01:36:55,197 --> 01:36:56,344
<font color="#696969">That's Katie.</font>

1042
01:36:58,325 --> 01:36:59,889
<font color="#696969">Katie Bell.</font>

1043
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:10,002
<font color="#696969">Katie. How are you?</font>

1044
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:15,111
<font color="#696969">I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.</font>

1045
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:20,324
<font color="#696969">I've been trying to remember, honestly.</font>

1046
01:37:20,741 --> 01:37:24,182
<font color="#696969">But I just can't.</font>

1047
01:37:37,424 --> 01:37:38,779
<font color="#696969">Katie?</font>

1048
01:38:21,214 --> 01:38:25,281
<font color="#696969">I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?</font>

1049
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:57,602
<font color="#696969">Sectumsempra!</font>

1050
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:47,545
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1051
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:52,028
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1052
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,241
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1053
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:21,847
<font color="#696969">You have to get rid of it. Today.</font>

1054
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:28,312
<font color="#696969">Take my hand.</font>

1055
01:40:44,368 --> 01:40:46,245
<font color="#696969">The Room of Requirement.</font>

1056
01:40:52,709 --> 01:40:55,316
<font color="#696969">We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book....</font>

1057
01:40:55,525 --> 01:40:59,174
<font color="#696969">....where no one will ever find it, including you.</font>

1058
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:08,975
<font color="#696969">~ What was that?
~ What was that?</font>

1059
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,500
<font color="#696969">See?</font>

1060
01:41:37,022 --> 01:41:39,003
<font color="#696969">You never know what you'll find up here.</font>

1061
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:02,149
<font color="#696969">All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.</font>

1062
01:42:06,007 --> 01:42:07,675
<font color="#696969">Close your eyes.</font>

1063
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:37,182
<font color="#696969">That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.</font>

1064
01:42:51,883 --> 01:42:54,281
<font color="#696969">So did you and Ginny do it, then?</font>

1065
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:55,532
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

1066
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:57,826
<font color="#696969">You know, hide the book?</font>

1067
01:42:58,034 --> 01:42:59,911
<font color="#696969">Oh, yeah.</font>

1068
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:05,333
<font color="#696969">Ah. Dear, yes.</font>

1069
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,356
<font color="#696969">Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?</font>

1070
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:11,693
<font color="#696969">Luck.</font>

1071
01:43:12,736 --> 01:43:16,072
<font color="#696969">That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.</font>

1072
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:37,446
<font color="#696969">Well, how do you feel?</font>

1073
01:43:37,655 --> 01:43:39,219
<font color="#696969">Excellent.</font>

1074
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,451
<font color="#696969">Really excellent.</font>

1075
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:46,726
<font color="#696969">Remember....</font>

1076
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,811
<font color="#696969">....Slughorn usually eats early....</font>

1077
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:52,043
<font color="#696969">....takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.</font>

1078
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:53,711
<font color="#696969">Right.</font>

1079
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:56,214
<font color="#696969">~ I'm going down to Hagrid's.
~ What?</font>

1080
01:43:56,422 --> 01:43:59,133
<font color="#696969">No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.</font>

1081
01:44:00,697 --> 01:44:03,303
<font color="#696969">~ We have a plan.
~ I know....</font>

1082
01:44:03,408 --> 01:44:05,493
<font color="#696969">....but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.</font>

1083
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:09,455
<font color="#696969">I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?</font>

1084
01:44:10,289 --> 01:44:12,583
<font color="#696969">~ No.
~ Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.</font>

1085
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,877
<font color="#696969">Or Felix does.</font>

1086
01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:17,483
<font color="#696969">Hi!</font>

1087
01:44:48,137 --> 01:44:49,805
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard, Harry!</font>

1088
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:54,184
<font color="#696969">Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.</font>

1089
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,269
<font color="#696969">You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.</font>

1090
01:44:56,478 --> 01:44:59,814
<font color="#696969">Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?</font>

1091
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:02,108
<font color="#696969">Well, just the general behavior, sir.</font>

1092
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:05,028
<font color="#696969">The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.</font>

1093
01:45:05,236 --> 01:45:08,781
<font color="#696969">Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?</font>

1094
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,283
<font color="#696969">Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.</font>

1095
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:15,037
<font color="#696969">Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.</font>

1096
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:18,999
<font color="#696969">My own interests
are purely academic, of course.</font>

1097
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:22,440
<font color="#696969">Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.</font>

1098
01:45:25,672 --> 01:45:27,861
<font color="#696969">How did you get out of the castle, Harry?</font>

1099
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:29,529
<font color="#696969">Through the front door, sir.</font>

1100
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:31,823
<font color="#696969">I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend....</font>

1101
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,700
<font color="#696969">....and I fancied paying him a visit.</font>

1102
01:45:33,909 --> 01:45:36,202
<font color="#696969">So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.</font>

1103
01:45:37,036 --> 01:45:38,600
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

1104
01:45:39,435 --> 01:45:41,937
<font color="#696969">~ Sir?
~ It's nearly nightfall.</font>

1105
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:45,482
<font color="#696969">Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.</font>

1106
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:48,297
<font color="#696969">Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.</font>

1107
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:56,847
<font color="#696969">Harry, I must insist
you accompany me....</font>

1108
01:45:57,055 --> 01:45:58,723
<font color="#696969">....back to the castle immediately!</font>

1109
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:02,164
<font color="#696969">That would be counterproductive, sir.</font>

1110
01:46:03,519 --> 01:46:05,605
<font color="#696969">And what makes you say that?</font>

1111
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:08,316
<font color="#696969">No idea.</font>

1112
01:46:15,093 --> 01:46:16,448
<font color="#696969">Horace.</font>

1113
01:46:17,074 --> 01:46:22,391
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?</font>

1114
01:46:23,017 --> 01:46:25,102
<font color="#696969">A dead one, I think, sir.</font>

1115
01:46:25,832 --> 01:46:27,396
<font color="#696969">Good God.</font>

1116
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:31,149
<font color="#696969">Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?</font>

1117
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:34,903
<font color="#696969">Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.</font>

1118
01:46:35,007 --> 01:46:39,282
<font color="#696969">~ I'm so sorry, I didn't....
~ Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.</font>

1119
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:43,244
<font color="#696969">Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.</font>

1120
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,538
<font color="#696969">It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.</font>

1121
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,936
<font color="#696969">Not to mention the pincers.</font>

1122
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:54,192
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I reckon that too.</font>

1123
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:58,258
<font color="#696969">Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate....</font>

1124
01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:02,533
<font color="#696969">....but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.</font>

1125
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:04,931
<font color="#696969">Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?</font>

1126
01:47:05,139 --> 01:47:07,746
<font color="#696969">Purely for academic purposes, you understand.</font>

1127
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,769
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?</font>

1128
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:12,229
<font color="#696969">My thoughts exactly.</font>

1129
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:18,902
<font color="#696969">Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.</font>

1130
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:24,115
<font color="#696969">Old Potions Master's habit, you know.</font>

1131
01:47:24,845 --> 01:47:27,243
<font color="#696969">I wish you could've seen him in his prime.</font>

1132
01:47:27,452 --> 01:47:31,101
<font color="#696969">Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.</font>

1133
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:34,125
<font color="#696969">Oh, dear.</font>

1134
01:47:43,821 --> 01:47:47,053
<font color="#696969">~ Would you like me to say a few words?
~ Yes.</font>

1135
01:47:47,262 --> 01:47:48,826
<font color="#696969">He had a family, I trust?</font>

1136
01:47:49,034 --> 01:47:50,494
<font color="#696969">Oh, yeah.</font>

1137
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:57,271
<font color="#696969">Farewell....</font>

1138
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,356
<font color="#696969">Aragog.</font>

1139
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,759
<font color="#696969">Farewell, Aragog....</font>

1140
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:09,887
<font color="#696969">....king of the arachnids.</font>

1141
01:48:10,721 --> 01:48:13,223
<font color="#696969">Your body will decay....</font>

1142
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:17,290
<font color="#696969">....but your spirit lingers on.</font>

1143
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:24,692
<font color="#696969">And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.</font>

1144
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:43,460
<font color="#696969">I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.</font>

1145
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:47,318
<font color="#696969">No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.</font>

1146
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:52,739
<font color="#696969">How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.</font>

1147
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:58,057
<font color="#696969">One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.</font>

1148
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,829
<font color="#696969">Poof.</font>

1149
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:03,166
<font color="#696969">~ That's very odd, isn't it?
~ It is, isn't it?</font>

1150
01:49:03,374 --> 01:49:07,023
<font color="#696969">But that's life, I suppose.</font>

1151
01:49:07,232 --> 01:49:12,549
<font color="#696969">You go along and then suddenly, poof!</font>

1152
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:16,407
<font color="#696969">~ Poof.
~ Poof.</font>

1153
01:49:31,004 --> 01:49:34,028
<font color="#696969">It was a student who gave me Francis.</font>

1154
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,345
<font color="#696969">One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk....</font>

1155
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:43,203
<font color="#696969">....with just a few inches
of clear water in it.</font>

1156
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:47,582
<font color="#696969">And floating on the surface was a flower petal.</font>

1157
01:49:49,146 --> 01:49:51,544
<font color="#696969">As I watched, it sank.</font>

1158
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:55,923
<font color="#696969">Just before it reached the bottom....</font>

1159
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:57,591
<font color="#696969">....it transformed....</font>

1160
01:49:58,947 --> 01:50:00,719
<font color="#696969">....into a wee fish.</font>

1161
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:04,577
<font color="#696969">It was beautiful magic.</font>

1162
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,809
<font color="#696969">Wondrous to behold.</font>

1163
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,231
<font color="#696969">The flower petal had come from a lily.</font>

1164
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:16,567
<font color="#696969">Your mother.</font>

1165
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:21,155
<font color="#696969">The day I came downstairs....</font>

1166
01:50:22,093 --> 01:50:24,387
<font color="#696969">....the day the bowl was empty....</font>

1167
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:28,141
<font color="#696969">....was the day your mother....</font>

1168
01:50:32,103 --> 01:50:34,084
<font color="#696969">I know why you're here.</font>

1169
01:50:37,107 --> 01:50:39,088
<font color="#696969">But I can't help you.</font>

1170
01:50:40,965 --> 01:50:42,633
<font color="#696969">It would ruin me.</font>

1171
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:48,785
<font color="#696969">Do you know why I survived, professor?</font>

1172
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,183
<font color="#696969">The night I got this?</font>

1173
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:54,519
<font color="#696969">Because of her.</font>

1174
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:57,230
<font color="#696969">Because she sacrificed herself.</font>

1175
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:00,045
<font color="#696969">Because she refused to step aside.</font>

1176
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:03,486
<font color="#696969">Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.</font>

1177
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,344
<font color="#696969">~ Don't say his name.
~ I'm not afraid of the name, professor.</font>

1178
01:51:08,178 --> 01:51:10,263
<font color="#696969">I'm going to tell you something.</font>

1179
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:14,121
<font color="#696969">Something others have only guessed at.</font>

1180
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:17,666
<font color="#696969">It's true.</font>

1181
01:51:18,187 --> 01:51:19,543
<font color="#696969">I am the Chosen One.</font>

1182
01:51:20,481 --> 01:51:22,670
<font color="#696969">Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so....</font>

1183
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:26,215
<font color="#696969">....I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office....</font>

1184
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,718
<font color="#696969">....and I need to know what you told him.</font>

1185
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,846
<font color="#696969">Be brave, professor.</font>

1186
01:51:33,514 --> 01:51:35,599
<font color="#696969">Be brave like my mother.</font>

1187
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,561
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, you disgrace her.</font>

1188
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,898
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, she died for nothing.</font>

1189
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:49,153
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.</font>

1190
01:51:59,684 --> 01:52:02,812
<font color="#696969">Please, don't think badly of me when you see it.</font>

1191
01:52:04,897 --> 01:52:08,129
<font color="#696969">You've no idea what he was like, even then.</font>

1192
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:47,541
<font color="#696969">I was in the library the other night....</font>

1193
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,939
<font color="#696969">....in the Restricted Section....</font>

1194
01:52:50,773 --> 01:52:54,422
<font color="#696969">....and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.</font>

1195
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:58,489
<font color="#696969">It's called, as I understand it....</font>

1196
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,095
<font color="#696969">....a Horcrux.</font>

1197
01:53:02,972 --> 01:53:05,683
<font color="#696969">~ I beg your pardon?
~ Horcrux.</font>

1198
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:08,811
<font color="#696969">I came across the term while reading....</font>

1199
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,939
<font color="#696969">....and I didn't fully understand it.</font>

1200
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:13,816
<font color="#696969">I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom....</font>

1201
01:53:14,024 --> 01:53:16,631
<font color="#696969">....but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.</font>

1202
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:18,299
<font color="#696969">Which is....</font>

1203
01:53:19,446 --> 01:53:21,322
<font color="#696969">....why I came to you.</font>

1204
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:29,768
<font color="#696969">A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.</font>

1205
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:32,583
<font color="#696969">But I don't understand
how that works, sir.</font>

1206
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,152
<font color="#696969">One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.</font>

1207
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,905
<font color="#696969">By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.</font>

1208
01:53:43,114 --> 01:53:44,260
<font color="#696969">Protected?</font>

1209
01:53:44,365 --> 01:53:47,597
<font color="#696969">That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.</font>

1210
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:51,455
<font color="#696969">In other words, you cannot die.</font>

1211
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:01,777
<font color="#696969">And how does one split his soul, sir?</font>

1212
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:04,800
<font color="#696969">I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.</font>

1213
01:54:06,052 --> 01:54:07,511
<font color="#696969">Murder.</font>

1214
01:54:08,033 --> 01:54:09,284
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

1215
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:14,810
<font color="#696969">Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.</font>

1216
01:54:15,644 --> 01:54:20,440
<font color="#696969">Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven....?</font>

1217
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:22,108
<font color="#696969">Seven?</font>

1218
01:54:22,838 --> 01:54:28,155
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?</font>

1219
01:54:28,364 --> 01:54:32,013
<font color="#696969">To rip the soul into seven pieces....</font>

1220
01:54:33,264 --> 01:54:36,288
<font color="#696969">This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?</font>

1221
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:42,335
<font color="#696969">Of course, sir.</font>

1222
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,340
<font color="#696969">It'll be our little secret.</font>

1223
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,349
<font color="#696969">Sir.</font>

1224
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,866
<font color="#696969">This is beyond anything I imagined.</font>

1225
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,785
<font color="#696969">You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?</font>

1226
01:55:17,889 --> 01:55:21,017
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.</font>

1227
01:55:21,226 --> 01:55:22,268
<font color="#696969">What are they exactly?</font>

1228
01:55:22,373 --> 01:55:25,709
<font color="#696969">Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.</font>

1229
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:30,609
<font color="#696969">A ring, for example.</font>

1230
01:55:31,235 --> 01:55:32,695
<font color="#696969">Or a book.</font>

1231
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,448
<font color="#696969">~ Tom Riddle's diary.
~ It's a Horcrux, yes.</font>

1232
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:39,055
<font color="#696969">Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life....</font>

1233
01:55:39,263 --> 01:55:41,453
<font color="#696969">....in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.</font>

1234
01:55:41,661 --> 01:55:43,538
<font color="#696969">I knew this was
a different kind of magic.</font>

1235
01:55:43,747 --> 01:55:48,751
<font color="#696969">Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.</font>

1236
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,941
<font color="#696969">~ The ring?
~ Belonged to Voldemort's mother.</font>

1237
01:55:51,358 --> 01:55:56,050
<font color="#696969">Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.</font>

1238
01:55:56,258 --> 01:56:00,116
<font color="#696969">But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux....</font>

1239
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:01,471
<font color="#696969">One destroys Voldemort.</font>

1240
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:04,495
<font color="#696969">But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.</font>

1241
01:56:04,704 --> 01:56:07,936
<font color="#696969">True. But magic, especially dark magic....</font>

1242
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,784
<font color="#696969">....leaves traces.</font>

1243
01:56:31,604 --> 01:56:33,689
<font color="#696969">It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?</font>

1244
01:56:33,897 --> 01:56:36,087
<font color="#696969">~ When you leave the school?
~ Yes.</font>

1245
01:56:37,025 --> 01:56:40,049
<font color="#696969">And I think perhaps
I may have found another.</font>

1246
01:56:40,258 --> 01:56:44,324
<font color="#696969">But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.</font>

1247
01:56:45,888 --> 01:56:50,475
<font color="#696969">Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.</font>

1248
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,731
<font color="#696969">Have you ever considered
that you ask too much....</font>

1249
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,546
<font color="#696969">....that you take too much for granted?</font>

1250
01:56:59,755 --> 01:57:04,759
<font color="#696969">Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?</font>

1251
01:57:04,968 --> 01:57:07,053
<font color="#696969">Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.</font>

1252
01:57:07,992 --> 01:57:13,726
<font color="#696969">I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.</font>

1253
01:57:32,181 --> 01:57:33,745
<font color="#696969">Oh, Harry.</font>

1254
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,645
<font color="#696969">You need a shave, my friend.</font>

1255
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,735
<font color="#696969">You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.</font>

1256
01:57:45,839 --> 01:57:49,801
<font color="#696969">At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.</font>

1257
01:57:51,365 --> 01:57:53,763
<font color="#696969">Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.</font>

1258
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,744
<font color="#696969">I'm an old man.</font>

1259
01:57:55,849 --> 01:57:57,517
<font color="#696969">You still look the same to me, sir.</font>

1260
01:57:58,977 --> 01:58:02,000
<font color="#696969">Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.</font>

1261
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:05,337
<font color="#696969">A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.</font>

1262
01:58:08,152 --> 01:58:12,635
<font color="#696969">The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.</font>

1263
01:58:12,844 --> 01:58:16,284
<font color="#696969">I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.</font>

1264
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:18,265
<font color="#696969">But there is one condition:</font>

1265
01:58:18,474 --> 01:58:21,706
<font color="#696969">You must obey every command I give you, without question.</font>

1266
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:24,208
<font color="#696969">Yes, sir.</font>

1267
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:26,502
<font color="#696969">You do understand what I'm saying?</font>

1268
01:58:27,128 --> 01:58:29,526
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to hide, you hide.</font>

1269
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:32,028
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to run, you run.</font>

1270
01:58:32,237 --> 01:58:36,199
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.</font>

1271
01:58:41,412 --> 01:58:42,976
<font color="#696969">Your word, Harry.</font>

1272
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:46,104
<font color="#696969">My word.</font>

1273
01:58:46,938 --> 01:58:48,606
<font color="#696969">Take my arm.</font>

1274
01:58:50,066 --> 01:58:52,464
<font color="#696969">Sir, I thought you couldn't apparate within Hogwarts.</font>

1275
01:58:53,089 --> 01:58:56,530
<font color="#696969">Well, being me has its privileges.</font>

1276
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:45,430
<font color="#696969">This is the place.</font>

1277
01:59:46,264 --> 01:59:47,828
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

1278
01:59:48,766 --> 01:59:51,269
<font color="#696969">This place has known magic.</font>

1279
01:59:59,297 --> 02:00:00,861
<font color="#696969">~ Sir!
~ In order to gain passage....</font>

1280
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,425
<font color="#696969">....payment must be made.</font>

1281
02:00:02,633 --> 02:00:06,282
<font color="#696969">Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.</font>

1282
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:09,619
<font color="#696969">~ You should've let me, sir.
~ No, Harry.</font>

1283
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,851
<font color="#696969">Your blood's much more precious than mine.</font>

1284
02:00:34,746 --> 02:00:39,334
<font color="#696969">Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.</font>

1285
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:42,879
<font color="#696969">He will have put certain defenses in position.</font>

1286
02:00:45,486 --> 02:00:46,841
<font color="#696969">Careful.</font>

1287
02:01:10,405 --> 02:01:11,552
<font color="#696969">There it is.</font>

1288
02:01:13,011 --> 02:01:15,722
<font color="#696969">The only question is,
how do we get there?</font>

1289
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:39,703
<font color="#696969">If you would, Harry.</font>

1290
02:02:27,038 --> 02:02:29,436
<font color="#696969">Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?</font>

1291
02:02:30,062 --> 02:02:31,418
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

1292
02:02:42,574 --> 02:02:44,138
<font color="#696969">It has to be drunk.</font>

1293
02:02:44,346 --> 02:02:47,161
<font color="#696969">All of it has to be drunk.</font>

1294
02:02:47,995 --> 02:02:51,332
<font color="#696969">You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?</font>

1295
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,938
<font color="#696969">This potion might paralyze me.</font>

1296
02:02:54,356 --> 02:02:56,024
<font color="#696969">Might make me forget why I'm here.</font>

1297
02:02:56,754 --> 02:03:00,090
<font color="#696969">Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.</font>

1298
02:03:00,299 --> 02:03:02,280
<font color="#696969">You are not to indulge these requests.</font>

1299
02:03:02,384 --> 02:03:05,929
<font color="#696969">It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.</font>

1300
02:03:06,137 --> 02:03:08,535
<font color="#696969">Even if you have to force it down my throat.</font>

1301
02:03:09,057 --> 02:03:11,142
<font color="#696969">~ Understood?
~ Why can't I drink it, sir?</font>

1302
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:16,772
<font color="#696969">Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.</font>

1303
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:22,715
<font color="#696969">Your good health, Harry.</font>

1304
02:03:38,876 --> 02:03:40,232
<font color="#696969">Professor.</font>

1305
02:03:42,317 --> 02:03:43,568
<font color="#696969">Professor!</font>

1306
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,701
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1307
02:03:51,909 --> 02:03:54,411
<font color="#696969">Professor, can you hear me?</font>

1308
02:03:55,663 --> 02:03:56,809
<font color="#696969">Professor.</font>

1309
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,387
<font color="#696969">No. Don't.</font>

1310
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:15,890
<font color="#696969">You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?</font>

1311
02:04:25,169 --> 02:04:27,046
<font color="#696969">~ Stop.
~ It will stop. It will stop....</font>

1312
02:04:27,254 --> 02:04:31,633
<font color="#696969">....but only if you keep drinking.
~ Please, don't make me.</font>

1313
02:04:31,842 --> 02:04:33,927
<font color="#696969">~ I'm sorry, sir.
~ Please.</font>

1314
02:04:34,136 --> 02:04:36,325
<font color="#696969">~ Kill me. Kill me!
~ No!</font>

1315
02:04:38,306 --> 02:04:39,349
<font color="#696969">It's my fault.</font>

1316
02:04:41,017 --> 02:04:42,268
<font color="#696969">It's all my fault.</font>

1317
02:04:44,145 --> 02:04:45,709
<font color="#696969">It's my fault.</font>

1318
02:04:45,918 --> 02:04:49,254
<font color="#696969">Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise....</font>

1319
02:04:49,984 --> 02:04:52,278
<font color="#696969">....I promise I'll do what you say.</font>

1320
02:04:52,486 --> 02:04:54,259
<font color="#696969">~ I promise.
~ No.</font>

1321
02:04:55,301 --> 02:04:56,657
<font color="#696969">Please.</font>

1322
02:05:20,846 --> 02:05:22,306
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1323
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:30,438
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1324
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:32,628
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1325
02:05:32,732 --> 02:05:34,504
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1326
02:05:41,073 --> 02:05:42,846
<font color="#696969">You did it, sir.</font>

1327
02:05:43,054 --> 02:05:44,514
<font color="#696969">Look.</font>

1328
02:05:46,495 --> 02:05:47,746
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1329
02:05:49,101 --> 02:05:50,457
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1330
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:53,898
<font color="#696969">Aguamenti.</font>

1331
02:05:54,106 --> 02:05:55,566
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1332
02:06:31,745 --> 02:06:33,101
<font color="#696969">Lumos.</font>

1333
02:07:01,565 --> 02:07:03,441
<font color="#696969">Lumos Maxima!</font>

1334
02:07:12,929 --> 02:07:14,702
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1335
02:07:18,768 --> 02:07:19,915
<font color="#696969">Sectumsempra!</font>

1336
02:07:20,124 --> 02:07:21,270
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1337
02:07:22,209 --> 02:07:23,773
<font color="#696969">~ Stupefy!
~ Harry.</font>

1338
02:08:22,995 --> 02:08:24,246
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1339
02:08:28,312 --> 02:08:30,606
<font color="#696969">Partis Temporus!</font>

1340
02:09:13,145 --> 02:09:16,273
<font color="#696969">Go to your houses. No dawdling.</font>

1341
02:09:57,145 --> 02:10:00,794
<font color="#696969">We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.</font>

1342
02:10:03,296 --> 02:10:04,652
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

1343
02:10:05,694 --> 02:10:08,405
<font color="#696969">Severus. Severus is who I need.</font>

1344
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:12,054
<font color="#696969">Wake him. Tell him what happened.</font>

1345
02:10:12,263 --> 02:10:13,931
<font color="#696969">Speak to no one else.</font>

1346
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:16,746
<font color="#696969">Severus, Harry.</font>

1347
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:24,462
<font color="#696969">Hide yourself below, Harry.</font>

1348
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:28,945
<font color="#696969">Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.</font>

1349
02:10:29,049 --> 02:10:32,907
<font color="#696969">Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.</font>

1350
02:10:33,637 --> 02:10:35,305
<font color="#696969">Harry, do as I say.</font>

1351
02:10:38,954 --> 02:10:40,205
<font color="#696969">Trust me.</font>

1352
02:10:41,978 --> 02:10:43,438
<font color="#696969">Trust me.</font>

1353
02:11:04,082 --> 02:11:05,854
<font color="#696969">Good evening, Draco.</font>

1354
02:11:06,793 --> 02:11:10,233
<font color="#696969">What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?</font>

1355
02:11:10,442 --> 02:11:12,214
<font color="#696969">Who else is here? I heard you talking.</font>

1356
02:11:12,423 --> 02:11:16,489
<font color="#696969">I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.</font>

1357
02:11:18,575 --> 02:11:21,390
<font color="#696969">Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?</font>

1358
02:11:23,892 --> 02:11:25,352
<font color="#696969">Draco....</font>

1359
02:11:26,081 --> 02:11:29,001
<font color="#696969">....you are no assassin.
~ How do you know what I am?</font>

1360
02:11:29,209 --> 02:11:30,982
<font color="#696969">I've done things that would shock you.</font>

1361
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:35,257
<font color="#696969">Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?</font>

1362
02:11:35,465 --> 02:11:38,072
<font color="#696969">Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?</font>

1363
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,844
<font color="#696969">Forgive me, Draco.</font>

1364
02:11:39,949 --> 02:11:42,451
<font color="#696969">I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak....</font>

1365
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:45,057
<font color="#696969">....your heart can't really have been in them.</font>

1366
02:11:45,162 --> 02:11:48,394
<font color="#696969">He trusts me. I was chosen.</font>

1367
02:11:52,252 --> 02:11:54,024
<font color="#696969">Then I shall make it easy for you.</font>

1368
02:11:54,128 --> 02:11:55,797
<font color="#696969">Expelliarmus!</font>

1369
02:11:59,133 --> 02:12:01,531
<font color="#696969">Very good. Very good.</font>

1370
02:12:03,304 --> 02:12:04,659
<font color="#696969">You're not alone.</font>

1371
02:12:05,806 --> 02:12:06,849
<font color="#696969">There are others.</font>

1372
02:12:08,934 --> 02:12:10,289
<font color="#696969">How?</font>

1373
02:12:11,645 --> 02:12:14,251
<font color="#696969">The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.</font>

1374
02:12:14,981 --> 02:12:17,379
<font color="#696969">~ I've been mending it.
~ Let me guess.</font>

1375
02:12:17,588 --> 02:12:20,507
<font color="#696969">It has a sister. A twin.</font>

1376
02:12:20,716 --> 02:12:22,905
<font color="#696969">In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.</font>

1377
02:12:23,114 --> 02:12:24,886
<font color="#696969">Ingenious.</font>

1378
02:12:25,512 --> 02:12:26,763
<font color="#696969">Draco....</font>

1379
02:12:26,971 --> 02:12:33,019
<font color="#696969">....years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.</font>

1380
02:12:33,957 --> 02:12:36,877
<font color="#696969">~ Please let me help you.
~ I don't want your help!</font>

1381
02:12:37,711 --> 02:12:41,151
<font color="#696969">Don't you understand? I have to do this.</font>

1382
02:12:42,402 --> 02:12:44,071
<font color="#696969">I have to kill you.</font>

1383
02:12:44,696 --> 02:12:46,677
<font color="#696969">Or he's gonna kill me.</font>

1384
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:59,815
<font color="#696969">Well, look what we have here.</font>

1385
02:13:01,691 --> 02:13:03,881
<font color="#696969">Well done, Draco.</font>

1386
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,407
<font color="#696969">Good evening, Bellatrix.</font>

1387
02:13:10,449 --> 02:13:12,639
<font color="#696969">I think introductions
are in order, don't you?</font>

1388
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:17,852
<font color="#696969">Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.</font>

1389
02:13:18,582 --> 02:13:19,937
<font color="#696969">Do it.</font>

1390
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:25,359
<font color="#696969">He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.</font>

1391
02:13:25,776 --> 02:13:27,236
<font color="#696969">Let me finish him in my own way.</font>

1392
02:13:27,444 --> 02:13:30,989
<font color="#696969">No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.</font>

1393
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:33,283
<font color="#696969">This is your moment. Do it.</font>

1394
02:13:34,847 --> 02:13:36,828
<font color="#696969">Go on, Draco.</font>

1395
02:13:36,932 --> 02:13:39,122
<font color="#696969">Now!</font>

1396
02:13:40,373 --> 02:13:41,729
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

1397
02:13:53,615 --> 02:13:55,179
<font color="#696969">Severus.</font>

1398
02:14:04,145 --> 02:14:05,605
<font color="#696969">Please.</font>

1399
02:14:06,648 --> 02:14:07,899
<font color="#696969">Avada Kedavra.</font>

1400
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,192
<font color="#696969">Yeah!</font>

1401
02:15:12,334 --> 02:15:15,774
<font color="#696969">Hagrid! Hello?</font>

1402
02:15:15,983 --> 02:15:20,049
<font color="#696969">Snape! He trusted you!</font>

1403
02:15:24,324 --> 02:15:25,992
<font color="#696969">Go on.</font>

1404
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:28,390
<font color="#696969">Incarcerous.</font>

1405
02:15:28,494 --> 02:15:31,205
<font color="#696969">Fight back! You coward, fight back!</font>

1406
02:15:32,874 --> 02:15:36,001
<font color="#696969">No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.</font>

1407
02:15:56,229 --> 02:15:57,584
<font color="#696969">Sectumsempra!</font>

1408
02:16:06,029 --> 02:16:11,243
<font color="#696969">You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?</font>

1409
02:16:12,077 --> 02:16:13,224
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

1410
02:16:13,953 --> 02:16:18,020
<font color="#696969">I'm the Half-Blood Prince.</font>

1411
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:07,608
<font color="#696969">Potter....</font>

1412
02:20:08,338 --> 02:20:10,736
<font color="#696969">....in light of what has happened....</font>

1413
02:20:12,196 --> 02:20:15,532
<font color="#696969">....if you should have the need to talk to someone....</font>

1414
02:20:17,513 --> 02:20:21,475
<font color="#696969">You should know,
Professor Dumbledore....</font>

1415
02:20:23,352 --> 02:20:25,750
<font color="#696969">....you meant a great deal to him.</font>

1416
02:20:43,996 --> 02:20:46,186
<font color="#696969">Do you think he would've done it?</font>

1417
02:20:46,394 --> 02:20:48,271
<font color="#696969">Draco?</font>

1418
02:20:49,314 --> 02:20:50,669
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

1419
02:20:51,816 --> 02:20:53,901
<font color="#696969">No, he was lowering his wand.</font>

1420
02:20:54,944 --> 02:20:56,821
<font color="#696969">In the end, it was Snape.</font>

1421
02:20:57,551 --> 02:20:59,949
<font color="#696969">It was always Snape.</font>

1422
02:21:00,157 --> 02:21:02,347
<font color="#696969">And I did nothing.</font>

1423
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:10,375
<font color="#696969">It's fake.</font>

1424
02:21:12,043 --> 02:21:13,294
<font color="#696969">Open it.</font>

1425
02:21:24,346 --> 02:21:28,308
<font color="#696969">"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this....</font>

1426
02:21:28,517 --> 02:21:32,166
<font color="#696969">....but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.</font>

1427
02:21:33,209 --> 02:21:37,066
<font color="#696969">I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.</font>

1428
02:21:37,275 --> 02:21:40,299
<font color="#696969">I face death in the hope that when you meet your match....</font>

1429
02:21:40,507 --> 02:21:42,697
<font color="#696969">....you will be mortal once more.</font>

1430
02:21:44,052 --> 02:21:45,616
<font color="#696969">R.A.B."</font>

1431
02:21:46,972 --> 02:21:48,327
<font color="#696969">R.A.B.</font>

1432
02:21:48,744 --> 02:21:49,995
<font color="#696969">Don't know.</font>

1433
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,687
<font color="#696969">But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.</font>

1434
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:57,189
<font color="#696969">Which means it was all a waste.</font>

1435
02:21:58,545 --> 02:22:00,004
<font color="#696969">All of it.</font>

1436
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:08,346
<font color="#696969">Ron's okay with it, you know.</font>

1437
02:22:08,867 --> 02:22:10,327
<font color="#696969">You and Ginny.</font>

1438
02:22:10,952 --> 02:22:14,706
<font color="#696969">But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.</font>

1439
02:22:16,061 --> 02:22:18,042
<font color="#696969">I'm not coming back, Hermione.</font>

1440
02:22:19,189 --> 02:22:21,900
<font color="#696969">I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.</font>

1441
02:22:22,108 --> 02:22:24,923
<font color="#696969">And I don't know where that'll lead me....</font>

1442
02:22:25,132 --> 02:22:28,677
<font color="#696969">....but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.</font>

1443
02:22:30,032 --> 02:22:32,639
<font color="#696969">I've always admired your courage, Harry.</font>

1444
02:22:32,848 --> 02:22:35,558
<font color="#696969">But sometimes, you can be really thick.</font>

1445
02:22:38,582 --> 02:22:40,772
<font color="#696969">You don't really think
you're going to be able....</font>

1446
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:43,378
<font color="#696969">....to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?</font>

1447
02:22:47,653 --> 02:22:49,217
<font color="#696969">You need us, Harry.</font>

1448
02:23:05,065 --> 02:23:08,193
<font color="#696969">I never realized
how beautiful this place was.</font>
