1
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:56,911
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:01,416
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,295
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:08,131
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...

5
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:11,134
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,054
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,804 --> 00:01:16,890
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:22,312
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,857
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,902
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,572
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,574
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,118
Beat up another
10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:39,788
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:44,584
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:50,048
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:55,053
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,138
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:02,435
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:05,105
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,608
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,819
She dead?

23
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,613
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,490
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:31,506
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,261
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,389
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,099
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,402
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,439
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:42,096
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:48,060
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,730
They might come back.

34
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,984
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?

35
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:59,071
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,449
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:05,036
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:09,040
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,876
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:14,712
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,007
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:22,845
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,648
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,942
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:39,028
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,364
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,703
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,915
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,209
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,382
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:03,386
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:06,347
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:10,893
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,229
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:17,233
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:33,249
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:38,671
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:43,551
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,845
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,057
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,394
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:56,273
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:01,403
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:07,868
Justice.

65
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,299
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,605
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,632
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,885
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,391
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,853
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,483
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,069
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,237
But the letter said...

74
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:10,449
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,784
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:16,329
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:18,790
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:22,794
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:32,262
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,106
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,609
Come on.

82
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,818
In you go, son.

83
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,821
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,740
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,784
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:20,872
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,585
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:30,173
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,509
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,846
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:41,476
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,732
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,862
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:56,407 --> 00:12:00,119
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:05,416
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,251
Yeah.

97
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:14,717
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:19,722
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,225
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:26,229
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,369
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,956
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,750
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,256
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,887
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,890
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:07,270
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,605
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,442
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,611
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,449
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,285
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,579
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,331
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:30,084
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,962
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,133
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.

118
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,384
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,763
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,266
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,812
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,939
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,942
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,320
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:01,532
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,202
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:08,831
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,084
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,835
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,338
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,591
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,927
He's as good as.

133
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,012
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,598
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,851
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,812
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:33,022
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:35,066
...about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,985
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,862
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,656
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,200
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,661
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:52,292
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,213
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,466
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,678
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,430
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,141
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,935
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:12,271
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,275
Sirius.

153
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:24,283
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,120
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,749
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,086
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:49,475
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,315
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,610
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,111
Why?

161
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,238
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,532
No one in their right
mind could believe that...

163
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,577
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:11,246
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,376
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,003
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,465
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:25,594
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,680
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:34,645
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,440
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:43,153
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,825
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:52,496
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:57,292
We believe...

176
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,212
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,505
Sirius.

178
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:08,011
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,515
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:15,728
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,689
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:22,693
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:37,041
Harry.

184
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,460
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,421
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:53,557
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,018
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,037
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,293
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:26,340
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:09,259
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:12,721
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,890
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:40,665
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:44,836
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:48,965
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:57,557
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:01,102
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,355
In five minutes.

200
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:14,282
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:20,955
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:23,208
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:33,802
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:37,514
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,059
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,936
Yes?

207
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,398
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,818
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,282
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:59,411
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:03,206
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:06,459
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...

213
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,461
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:11,798
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:15,552
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:19,097
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:21,850
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:25,979
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,108
The charges?

220
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:32,819
The charges against the
accused are as follows:

221
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:34,612
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:38,366
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,536
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:44,956
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:48,418
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:52,047
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:55,091
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:58,636
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:01,014
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,393
Dementors?

231
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,687
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:10,190
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:13,485
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?

234
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,904
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:18,656
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:22,994
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:27,665
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:32,462
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,885
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,473
What did they look like?

241
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:49,480
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:53,359
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,196
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:03,035
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:07,039
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:12,336
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:16,132
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,050
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:21,220
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:26,642
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.

251
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:32,314
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:36,694
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:40,865
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:43,826
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:48,164
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,709
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:55,254
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.

258
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,340
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:01,260
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:08,934
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:13,647
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:16,609
He is not back.

263
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,700
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,703
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:32,333
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,419
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

267
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:38,756
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:41,801
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?

269
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:53,771
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:07,535
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:23,884
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,681
Professor.

273
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,697
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:47,199
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,252
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...

276
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:01,047
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,342
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,887
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:09,513
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,935
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:23,361
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:25,613
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,366
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,911
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,121
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,790
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:35,956 --> 00:26:39,627
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.

288
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:44,049
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:49,096
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,436
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:02,109
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,156
You keep it.

293
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:13,036
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:17,082
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:19,292
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:21,670
I love you.

297
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,423
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:26,967
There they are. They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,427
Bye.

300
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,555
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:15,223
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,685
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.

303
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:25,233
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,278
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,947
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:52,094
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,929
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:08,527
What is it?

309
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:13,949
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:17,077
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:19,955
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:35,804
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,600
I can see them too.

314
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,479
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:51,361
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:56,074
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:02,330
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:05,042
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,003
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:13,258
Hungry.

321
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,927
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:20,515
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:34,821
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:38,867
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:42,080
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,832
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,461
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:53,299
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:56,636
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:56,928 --> 00:31:00,681
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:06,479
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...

332
00:31:17,573 --> 00:31:20,284
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:26,165
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:31,212
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:34,215
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,762
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:42,181
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,979
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:53,735
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,404
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:01,409
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:09,083
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.

343
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:13,671
Let us preserve what must be preserved...

344
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:17,341
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:24,098
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:35,276
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:39,822
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:42,742
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,454
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,975
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,436
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:13,022
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,651
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.

354
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:20,154
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:23,950
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:25,451
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:27,537
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:30,790
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,460
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:37,130
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:40,383
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,176
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:45,179
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:57,025
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:59,986
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,323
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:12,373
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:41,862
Harry.

369
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,463
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:03,258
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,275
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:27,449
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,244
O-W-Ls.

374
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:34,957
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,293
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:43,882
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:54,518
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,812
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...

379
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,482
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,360
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,322
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:08,991
Using spells?

383
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,619
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:15,956
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:21,128
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:24,048
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:27,176
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:33,182
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,143
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...

390
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,270
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:40,898
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.

392
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,859
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?

393
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:46,028
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:49,239
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:52,701
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:07,841
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:09,885
You have been told...

398
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:15,391
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.

399
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,729
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:22,523
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,858
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

402
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,444
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,780
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,448
Enough!

405
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,784
Enough.

406
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:38,247
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:04,231
Come in.

408
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:11,405
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:13,282
Sit.

410
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,918
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,962
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,382
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,931
Now...

414
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:43,772
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

415
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,734
How many times?

416
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:52,822
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,493
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,161
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,922
Yes?

420
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:01,641
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,521
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:08,732
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,068
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:17,907
Go on.

425
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,252
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:31,046
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:34,966
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,302
Care for another?

429
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,013
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.

430
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,141
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,435
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:49,356
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:49,522 --> 00:40:53,777
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,909
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:02,911
Nothing.

436
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,081
The other hand.

437
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,418
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:12,796
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.

439
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:15,090
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:17,675
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.

441
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,805
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,060
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:27,227 --> 00:41:30,772
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:33,775
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.

445
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:36,820
You don't understand.

446
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:41,366
Then help us to.

447
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:57,966
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,218
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:05,014
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:12,355
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,526
I know you, of all people, will understand.

452
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:52,855
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:55,483 --> 00:43:00,112
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,034
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:08,704
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:18,672
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,428
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:28,974
Different.

459
00:43:32,103 --> 00:43:34,438
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:38,150
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.

461
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:42,905
So you've known someone who's died, then?

462
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,699
My mum.

463
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:50,121
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:53,624
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:56,168
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,963
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,468
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.

468
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,306
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:12,393 --> 00:44:15,396
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

470
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:18,649
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:23,195
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.

472
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:24,697
I don't think that's true.

473
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:30,202
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,163
What do you mean?

475
00:44:32,788 --> 00:44:34,665
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:38,669
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...

477
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:41,589
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:44:42,423 --> 00:44:44,759
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:07,156
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:11,577
Harry.

481
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:14,663
Can I join you?

482
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:19,710
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:22,630
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:27,051
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,886
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:33,224
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...

487
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,725
...Minerva.

488
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:39,355
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.

489
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:42,108
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:45,569
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:48,906
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:50,658
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:55,913
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:57,665 --> 00:45:59,417
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:05,131
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:08,759
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

497
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:22,106
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:22,273 --> 00:46:24,817
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:27,653
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:32,784
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:39,458
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:47,257 --> 00:46:49,426
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:49,593 --> 00:46:53,805
You've been in this post how long, exactly?

504
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:05,692
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,861
Yes.

506
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:10,906
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:12,115 --> 00:47:14,534
Obviously.

508
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,320
Could you please predict something for me?

509
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,240
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:00,706
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:09,923
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:15,804 --> 00:48:17,222
Pity.

513
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:20,225
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.

514
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,561
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:27,357
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,569
Lovely.

517
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:42,914
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:45,417
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,742
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,870
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,665
You can't do this.

522
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,378
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,638
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:42,474
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.

525
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,601
There...

526
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:03,161
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:04,496 --> 00:50:06,957
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:08,625
Thank you.

529
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:13,797
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...

530
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:17,259
...of Educational Decree Number
23, as enacted by the minister...

531
00:50:17,426 --> 00:50:20,595
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:24,307
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:27,519
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:29,563 --> 00:50:30,815
For now.

535
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:39,240
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:40,575
Professor.

537
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,494
Professor?

538
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:46,789
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:49,083
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:01,888
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:07,435
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,854
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:14,692
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:17,695
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:20,740
...that these disappearances are the work...

546
00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:24,285
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:26,579
Harry.

548
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:28,539
Sirius.

549
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,959
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:35,046
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:37,131
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:37,298 --> 00:51:40,259
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:44,722
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:45,890
Combat?

555
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:49,268
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:49,477 --> 00:51:50,853
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,941
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:55,483 --> 00:51:58,778
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

559
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:02,615
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:05,993
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

561
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,788
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...

562
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:12,959
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:17,130
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:18,923
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:20,967
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:21,134 --> 00:52:23,302
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:28,474
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:42,363
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:46,868
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:47,452 --> 00:52:51,205
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.

571
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:10,391
Harry.

572
00:53:19,984 --> 00:53:22,362
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:23,738
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:28,409
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:32,121
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:32,622 --> 00:53:34,957
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:37,251
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:43,716
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:47,428 --> 00:53:49,555
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:51,891
Matey, come back here.

581
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:01,484
Hi.

582
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:04,779
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:06,197
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:10,076
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:10,368 --> 00:54:13,538
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:13,705 --> 00:54:15,456
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:17,709
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.

588
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,419
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,754
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:24,298
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:28,721
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:35,602
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:39,189
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:41,984
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,739
Yes.

596
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:49,616
I've seen it.

597
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:51,910
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.

598
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,749
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:54:56,915 --> 00:54:58,125
It's true.

600
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,086
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:05,174
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,633
Wait.

603
00:55:07,342 --> 00:55:11,889
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:15,601
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.

605
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:19,646
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:19,813 --> 00:55:23,275
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:30,532
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.

608
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:34,995
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,663
But out there...

610
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,584
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...

611
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:44,463
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:55:47,216 --> 00:55:49,009
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:00,688
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,565
That's why we need your help.

615
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,652
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...

616
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:10,030
...Voldemort...

617
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,202
He's really back.

618
00:56:37,516 --> 00:56:39,184
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...

619
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:40,728
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:43,063
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:46,233
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,485
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:49,820
Who cares?

624
00:56:50,446 --> 00:56:55,284
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

625
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,745
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

626
00:56:58,454 --> 00:57:02,082
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,584
What's that?

628
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:07,963
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?

629
00:57:10,716 --> 00:57:13,761
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...

630
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:16,764
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,768
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:22,770
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:35,657
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:39,411
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

635
00:57:39,661 --> 00:57:42,122
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:22,079
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:23,372
The what?

638
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:25,958
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,546
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:29,713 --> 00:58:32,382
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:36,302
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:42,308
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.

643
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:47,355
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:58,366 --> 00:58:59,868
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,416
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:10,378
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:17,761
You will please copy the
approved text four times...

648
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:20,930
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:25,018
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:59:25,185 --> 00:59:27,187
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:43,203
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.

652
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,622
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:49,376
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:55,882 --> 00:59:57,258
Stupefy!

655
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,601
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:14,067
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:14,442 --> 01:00:16,444
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,324
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:24,369
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,913
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
01:00:34,003 --> 01:00:35,338
Stupefy.

662
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,971
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:47,976
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?

664
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:52,772
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:21,342
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:27,599
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

667
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:30,143
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:34,272
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,859
Great.

670
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:40,737
A little higher.

671
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:52,040
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,727
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:17,649
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

674
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:20,694
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,487
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,707
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:35,084
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,378
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,088
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,259
Every great wizard in
history has started out...

681
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:47,513
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.

682
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,599
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:02,570
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,115
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,286
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,126
Reducto.

687
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,642
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:36,187
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,151
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,408
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,162
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,749
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

693
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,169
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.

694
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,714
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.

695
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,970
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,555
Thanks.

697
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,605
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,117
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,204
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:39,375
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,211
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,213
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,007
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,552
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,388
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,099
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:10,781
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,325
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,829
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,337
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,550
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

712
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,428
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,431
He was really good.

714
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,768
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,107
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,278
I've never been able to stun anything before.

717
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,122
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,544
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,297
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,758
No idea.

721
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,991
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,494
Wet.

723
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,663
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,040
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,918
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,923
Cho spends half her time crying these days.

727
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,342
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.

728
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:56,680
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:04,563
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,816
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:11,194
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:15,115
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,620
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.

734
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:24,041
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...

735
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,516
Harry.

736
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:53,362
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:57,032
Something he didn't have last time.

738
01:07:57,866 --> 01:07:59,117
Harry.

739
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,037
Harry.

740
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,530
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...

741
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,198
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:41,618
Neither. It was like I...

743
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,287
Will you please just tell me what's happening?

744
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,790
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,376
Make sure he's found by the right people.

746
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:51,086
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,588
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,383
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...

749
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:00,721
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.

750
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,932
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,643
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,729
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

753
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,105
Look at me!

754
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,822
What's happening to me?

755
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,582
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:33,670
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.

757
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,965
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,305
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,849
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.

760
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:50,187
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,565
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:57,027
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:09:57,486 --> 01:10:01,865
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,909
...unhinge it.

765
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:07,454
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,873
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,627
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:19,549
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...

769
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:24,013
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,390
...kill them.

771
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,810
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...

772
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:32,480
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:37,402
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.

774
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:41,072
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:10:41,364 --> 01:10:42,824
Prepare yourself.

776
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:46,786
Legilimens.

777
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:58,506
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:26,034
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:29,912
Here we go.

780
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,248
Daddy's back.

781
01:11:35,418 --> 01:11:39,047
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:43,593
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:11:46,387 --> 01:11:48,598
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:11:48,765 --> 01:11:51,059
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:53,644
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:58,107
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:11:58,274 --> 01:12:01,152
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:03,321
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:12:03,488 --> 01:12:05,406
There you are.

790
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,242
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:12:08,826 --> 01:12:10,661
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,830
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:14,707
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:16,250
Fred? George?

795
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:18,961
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:12:19,128 --> 01:12:21,005
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:12:22,006 --> 01:12:24,842
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:30,765
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:32,183
Harry.

800
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:35,770
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.

801
01:12:35,937 --> 01:12:38,314
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:12:39,232 --> 01:12:41,984
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:45,279
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:47,281
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,325
I don't know why...

806
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:59,919
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.

807
01:13:00,086 --> 01:13:04,841
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:08,011
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:13:08,428 --> 01:13:11,014
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:13:11,222 --> 01:13:14,058
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!

811
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:16,185
Of course, master.

812
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:21,065
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:25,278
Sorry about that.

814
01:13:25,862 --> 01:13:29,532
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:31,951
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:34,746
What, you grew up here?

817
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:37,165
This is my parents' house.

818
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:41,335
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:13:42,462 --> 01:13:45,757
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.

820
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:49,510
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:52,555
My deranged cousin.

822
01:13:52,722 --> 01:13:55,433
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,313
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:07,320
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:11,532
Charming woman.

826
01:14:12,784 --> 01:14:14,410
I was 16.

827
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,704
Where did you go?

828
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,042
Round your dad's.

829
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:24,088
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:27,716
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,552
You are so very much alike.

832
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:33,472
I'm not so sure.

833
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:35,974
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:43,315
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.

835
01:14:44,483 --> 01:14:45,984
I was the snake.

836
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:49,780
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:54,159
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

838
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:02,167
This connection between me and Voldemort.

839
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:06,422
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:15:07,756 --> 01:15:12,678
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:15:12,845 --> 01:15:17,391
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:21,145
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:27,026
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.

844
01:15:28,193 --> 01:15:31,196
You're not a bad person.

845
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:36,368
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.

846
01:15:36,994 --> 01:15:38,120
You understand?

847
01:15:40,205 --> 01:15:45,252
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:49,882
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

849
01:15:50,632 --> 01:15:53,886
What matters is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:58,140
That's who we really are.

851
01:16:01,894 --> 01:16:03,645
Harry, time to go.

852
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:09,693
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,445
You'll see.

854
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:13,947
Come on.

855
01:16:51,402 --> 01:16:52,569
Really?

856
01:16:52,736 --> 01:16:55,364
Harry. Harry.

857
01:16:55,531 --> 01:16:57,449
Hagrid's back.

858
01:17:00,411 --> 01:17:02,246
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:16,468 --> 01:17:19,596
I will say this one last time.

860
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:22,307
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.

861
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:25,477
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:17:25,811 --> 01:17:29,982
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:34,987
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:17:37,031 --> 01:17:39,533
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.

865
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,995
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

866
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:05,017
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:08,312
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

868
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:09,980
Giants?

869
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,191
You found them?

870
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:16,278
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:20,158
I tried to convince them to join the cause.

872
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,036
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.

873
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:25,663
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:29,459
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:32,337
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:36,591
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,513
And they did this to you?

878
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,973
Not exactly, no.

879
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:48,395
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

880
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,494
It's changing out there.

881
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:06,496
Just like last time.

882
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,582
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:13,378
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:19:50,415 --> 01:19:53,418
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...

885
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:56,463
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.

886
01:19:56,629 --> 01:20:00,258
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,552
We strongly suspect...

888
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:05,388
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:09,768
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:14,147
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:19,986
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:32,582
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

893
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:35,919
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.

894
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:37,212
Harry.

895
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:42,926
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:47,681
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

897
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:53,770
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.

898
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:02,320
Neville?

899
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:17,001
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:21,464
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:24,843
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:29,347
She tortured them for information...

903
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,683
...but they never gave in.

904
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:35,854
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,734
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:50,785
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.

907
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,752
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:02,338
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:22:02,505 --> 01:22:03,923
George, your turn now.

910
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:07,594
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:11,931
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...

912
01:22:12,098 --> 01:22:15,936
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:17,355
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:22:18,064 --> 01:22:19,607
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:22:19,774 --> 01:22:23,819
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,280
So focus, Luna.

917
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,702
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:33,829
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:36,874
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:41,295
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.

921
01:22:42,046 --> 01:22:44,465
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:28,801
I'll make short work of this.

923
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,138
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:51,824
Get them.

925
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,701
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:55,828
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:23:56,245 --> 01:23:59,957
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,377
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:05,087
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:07,339
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:11,344
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:12,511
Naturally.

933
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:15,181
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

934
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:19,018
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...

935
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:24,065
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,859
I instructed Harry to form this organization.

937
01:24:27,026 --> 01:24:30,488
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.

938
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:32,490
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:35,201
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

940
01:24:35,368 --> 01:24:40,164
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:41,749
...to Azkaban...

942
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,172
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:24:48,339 --> 01:24:51,258
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:55,888
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...

945
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,890
What was the phrase?

946
01:24:58,057 --> 01:24:59,642
...come quietly.

947
01:24:59,809 --> 01:25:01,519
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:25:01,936 --> 01:25:04,271
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:05,690
Enough of this.

950
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,274
Take him.

951
01:25:20,121 --> 01:25:24,500
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,794
...but you can't deny...

953
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:30,089
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:58,784
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:25:58,993 --> 01:26:02,413
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

956
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,626
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:12,089
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

958
01:27:23,286 --> 01:27:24,871
Harry.

959
01:27:31,837 --> 01:27:35,257
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.

960
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,759
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

961
01:27:38,677 --> 01:27:40,846
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:27:41,013 --> 01:27:43,098
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:45,267
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:27:45,809 --> 01:27:49,938
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.

965
01:27:51,982 --> 01:27:54,443
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:59,698
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:27:59,865 --> 01:28:02,534
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:28:02,701 --> 01:28:05,871
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

969
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:10,042
To go it alone.

970
01:28:16,381 --> 01:28:18,050
Hagrid.

971
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:24,222
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:27,434
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:38,445
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:28:38,612 --> 01:28:41,156
And they're dangerous at the best of times.

975
01:28:42,115 --> 01:28:44,451
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,787
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.

977
01:28:46,995 --> 01:28:48,622
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:51,041
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:56,171
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:28:56,838 --> 01:28:59,966
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

981
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:03,637
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:29:07,849 --> 01:29:09,476
Grawpy.

983
01:29:11,895 --> 01:29:13,980
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:29:20,362 --> 01:29:22,030
Grawpy.

985
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:24,491
Brought you some company.

986
01:29:36,878 --> 01:29:39,131
I couldn't just leave him, because...

987
01:29:39,297 --> 01:29:41,049
Because he's my brother.

988
01:29:41,216 --> 01:29:42,342
Blimey.

989
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:44,511
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,975
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:29:52,102 --> 01:29:54,438
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:29:54,604 --> 01:29:57,024
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?

993
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,443
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:29:59,609 --> 01:30:00,902
Grawpy.

995
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,408
Grawp.

996
01:30:08,452 --> 01:30:11,539
Put me down.

997
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:16,753
Now.

998
01:30:28,931 --> 01:30:30,016
You all right?

999
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:32,977
Fine.

1000
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:35,688
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:30:35,855 --> 01:30:38,274
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:42,904
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:15,812
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:31:17,063 --> 01:31:20,108
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.

1005
01:31:21,484 --> 01:31:23,695
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:31:24,195 --> 01:31:26,906
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:31:40,503 --> 01:31:42,338
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:49,470
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:31:49,762 --> 01:31:53,266
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:31:55,685 --> 01:31:58,855
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:31:59,022 --> 01:32:03,151
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,612
You're just like your father.

1013
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:08,573
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,992
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:13,327
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:32:13,953 --> 01:32:15,872
Control your emotions.

1017
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:19,000
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:23,004
Legilimens.

1019
01:32:30,219 --> 01:32:31,346
Harry.

1020
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:33,222
Sirius.

1021
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,224
I may vomit.

1022
01:32:35,558 --> 01:32:36,559
Stop it.

1023
01:32:37,727 --> 01:32:40,021
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:43,566
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.

1025
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:47,153
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,698
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:54,827
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:32:54,994 --> 01:32:58,373
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.

1029
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:02,502
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:33:02,668 --> 01:33:05,713
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:33:06,756 --> 01:33:08,216
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:15,348
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:33:15,515 --> 01:33:17,558
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:33:17,767 --> 01:33:19,602
Nice one, James.

1035
01:33:19,936 --> 01:33:22,271
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1036
01:33:22,438 --> 01:33:24,399
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:33:24,607 --> 01:33:27,235
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1038
01:33:27,443 --> 01:33:29,696
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:31,072
Enough.

1040
01:33:33,032 --> 01:33:34,617
Enough.

1041
01:33:43,126 --> 01:33:45,753
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,046
I...

1043
01:33:47,213 --> 01:33:50,466
Get out.

1044
01:34:07,692 --> 01:34:09,862
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:34:10,029 --> 01:34:11,947
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:34:12,114 --> 01:34:15,117
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:34:15,325 --> 01:34:17,327
It's fading already.

1048
01:34:17,494 --> 01:34:22,249
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:32,343
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:34:32,509 --> 01:34:36,305
...naughty children deserve to be punished.

1051
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,684
You know, George...

1052
01:34:40,851 --> 01:34:44,521
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:34:44,688 --> 01:34:49,276
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:02,891
All right, professor!

1055
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:13,444
Here you go.

1056
01:36:38,385 --> 01:36:40,220
Ready when you are.

1057
01:38:05,973 --> 01:38:09,227
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:38:09,394 --> 01:38:11,229
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:38:12,063 --> 01:38:16,651
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:38:16,818 --> 01:38:18,528
Crucio.

1061
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:22,824
Crucio.

1062
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:35,670
Sirius.

1063
01:38:35,837 --> 01:38:36,838
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:38:37,005 --> 01:38:39,466
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:38:39,632 --> 01:38:41,509
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:38:41,676 --> 01:38:43,720
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:38:43,928 --> 01:38:45,847
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

1068
01:38:46,014 --> 01:38:49,309
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:38:49,476 --> 01:38:51,436
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:54,898
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?

1071
01:38:56,232 --> 01:38:59,361
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:38:59,527 --> 01:39:03,031
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1073
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:06,701
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:39:09,287 --> 01:39:10,288
What do we do?

1075
01:39:11,706 --> 01:39:13,333
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,585
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.

1077
01:39:15,752 --> 01:39:17,295
Not all of them.

1078
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:21,466
Alohomora.

1079
01:39:32,686 --> 01:39:34,396
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:39:34,562 --> 01:39:38,108
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:39:38,316 --> 01:39:41,945
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:39:42,112 --> 01:39:45,323
That you are.

1083
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:48,368
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:39:53,373 --> 01:39:55,458
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

1085
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:57,669
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:39:57,836 --> 01:40:00,672
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:04,300
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:40:04,759 --> 01:40:06,302
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:40:06,469 --> 01:40:09,347
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:40:09,514 --> 01:40:12,642
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:18,189
Unless you wish to poison him...

1092
01:40:18,356 --> 01:40:22,819
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:40:23,403 --> 01:40:25,363
...I cannot help you.

1094
01:40:27,782 --> 01:40:29,492
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:40:30,535 --> 01:40:33,997
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.

1096
01:40:34,497 --> 01:40:36,624
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,334
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:40:45,008 --> 01:40:47,010
No idea.

1099
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:53,058
Very well.

1100
01:40:54,059 --> 01:40:56,394
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:59,731
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:40:59,898 --> 01:41:01,983
...you leave me with...

1103
01:41:02,734 --> 01:41:04,694
...no alternative.

1104
01:41:05,487 --> 01:41:07,697
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:41:07,864 --> 01:41:08,865
That's illegal.

1106
01:41:09,032 --> 01:41:12,410
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.

1107
01:41:19,918 --> 01:41:21,419
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:41:22,921 --> 01:41:24,381
Tell me what?

1109
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:27,550
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:41:28,259 --> 01:41:30,011
...I will.

1111
01:41:31,638 --> 01:41:33,431
Where what is?

1112
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:36,935
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,483
How much further?

1114
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,318
Not far.

1115
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,032
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:56,830
What are you doing?

1117
01:41:56,996 --> 01:41:58,790
Improvising.

1118
01:42:07,299 --> 01:42:08,926
Well?

1119
01:42:10,219 --> 01:42:12,346
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:42:17,268 --> 01:42:19,520
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:42:22,314 --> 01:42:24,442
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:42:28,654 --> 01:42:30,239
You know...

1123
01:42:31,657 --> 01:42:33,659
...I really hate children.

1124
01:42:49,258 --> 01:42:53,679
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:42:56,349 --> 01:42:58,017
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:42:58,184 --> 01:43:03,731
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1127
01:43:03,898 --> 01:43:05,149
Protego.

1128
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:06,525
How dare you?

1129
01:43:07,193 --> 01:43:08,694
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:43:09,487 --> 01:43:10,488
Incarcerous.

1131
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:26,295
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:43:26,462 --> 01:43:31,133
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:43:39,975 --> 01:43:42,520
You filthy animal.

1134
01:43:42,728 --> 01:43:45,690
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:43:45,856 --> 01:43:48,693
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:43:48,859 --> 01:43:50,736
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:43:58,411 --> 01:44:01,872
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:03,958
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,918
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:44:06,085 --> 01:44:07,086
What are you doing?

1141
01:44:07,253 --> 01:44:11,090
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:13,759
Let me go!

1143
01:44:16,429 --> 01:44:18,264
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:44:18,431 --> 01:44:21,892
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:44:30,192 --> 01:44:33,738
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:44:33,946 --> 01:44:36,073
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.

1147
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,784
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:44:39,618 --> 01:44:41,120
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:44,457
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1150
01:44:44,623 --> 01:44:46,417
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:44:47,793 --> 01:44:51,339
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:44:52,173 --> 01:44:54,884
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:44:55,051 --> 01:44:58,012
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.

1154
01:44:58,346 --> 01:45:00,473
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:05,561
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:45:10,483 --> 01:45:12,610
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:16,280
We fly, of course.

1158
01:46:07,332 --> 01:46:09,501
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:46:18,343 --> 01:46:20,012
This is it.

1160
01:47:13,023 --> 01:47:15,359
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.

1161
01:47:17,069 --> 01:47:18,403
Ninety-four.

1162
01:47:19,696 --> 01:47:20,697
Ninety-five.

1163
01:47:33,293 --> 01:47:36,046
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:47:38,757 --> 01:47:40,050
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:48:05,242 --> 01:48:09,621
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:48:10,455 --> 01:48:12,874
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...

1167
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:15,836
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:48:21,508 --> 01:48:26,847
For neither can live while the other survives.

1169
01:48:29,349 --> 01:48:30,475
Harry.

1170
01:48:40,944 --> 01:48:42,446
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:48:42,612 --> 01:48:47,701
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,789
...and reality.

1173
01:48:54,041 --> 01:48:59,004
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1174
01:48:59,713 --> 01:49:01,173
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:03,467
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:49:06,219 --> 01:49:08,805
He knows how to play.

1177
01:49:08,972 --> 01:49:12,768
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:49:12,934 --> 01:49:14,186
Potter.

1179
01:49:14,728 --> 01:49:16,605
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:49:16,772 --> 01:49:19,733
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,735
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:29,368
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:49:29,868 --> 01:49:31,328
...shall we?

1184
01:49:31,536 --> 01:49:33,997
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:49:34,164 --> 01:49:36,375
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?

1186
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:38,168
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:49:39,711 --> 01:49:41,296
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:44,049
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:49:46,009 --> 01:49:51,473
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,393
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:49:58,146 --> 01:50:00,107
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:50:00,607 --> 01:50:05,780
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:50:06,531 --> 01:50:09,033
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,703
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:50:13,121 --> 01:50:17,917
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:50:18,835 --> 01:50:23,256
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1197
01:50:24,465 --> 01:50:26,426
All you have to do...

1198
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:28,970
...is give it to me.

1199
01:50:29,262 --> 01:50:32,557
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:50:41,315 --> 01:50:43,109
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:44,986
I know.

1202
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,240
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:50:49,407 --> 01:50:50,825
Stupefy.

1204
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,967
Levicorpus.

1205
01:51:14,515 --> 01:51:16,559
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:51:16,726 --> 01:51:18,519
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:51:26,986 --> 01:51:28,529
Stupefy.

1208
01:51:30,281 --> 01:51:31,491
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1209
01:51:42,668 --> 01:51:44,545
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:52,095 --> 01:51:54,389
Reducto.

1211
01:52:10,405 --> 01:52:12,532
Get back to the door.

1212
01:52:47,817 --> 01:52:52,321
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:52:57,535 --> 01:52:59,454
The voices.

1214
01:52:59,996 --> 01:53:02,040
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:05,877
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:53:06,627 --> 01:53:08,379
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:53:08,546 --> 01:53:10,131
I hear them too.

1218
01:53:13,259 --> 01:53:15,887
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,058
Please, Harry.

1220
01:53:20,808 --> 01:53:22,685
Get behind me.

1221
01:54:09,233 --> 01:54:11,944
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:16,699
...or were you truly naive enough to think...

1223
01:54:17,324 --> 01:54:22,454
...that children stood a chance against us?

1224
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:29,670
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:54:33,382 --> 01:54:36,719
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:54:36,885 --> 01:54:40,889
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:55,195
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:55:21,513 --> 01:55:24,266
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,965
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.

1230
01:55:57,299 --> 01:55:59,134
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:55:59,301 --> 01:56:02,137
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:56:02,805 --> 01:56:04,431
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,599
Black.

1234
01:56:32,793 --> 01:56:34,128
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:56:34,294 --> 01:56:35,629
Nice one, James.

1236
01:56:42,845 --> 01:56:44,346
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:57:04,533 --> 01:57:06,827
No. No.

1238
01:57:30,809 --> 01:57:33,479
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:57:34,438 --> 01:57:36,398
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1240
01:57:48,744 --> 01:57:51,872
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:57:52,081 --> 01:57:55,834
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:57:59,673 --> 01:58:02,884
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:58:14,437 --> 01:58:16,064
Do it.

1244
01:58:23,738 --> 01:58:26,700
So weak.

1245
01:58:33,456 --> 01:58:36,668
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.

1246
01:58:36,835 --> 01:58:38,586
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:58:38,753 --> 01:58:42,924
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:58:44,467 --> 01:58:46,594
...shall be dead.

1249
02:01:00,895 --> 02:01:02,772
You've lost, old man.

1250
02:01:22,959 --> 02:01:23,918
Harry.

1251
02:01:28,089 --> 02:01:29,549
So weak.

1252
02:01:30,091 --> 02:01:32,302
So vulnerable.

1253
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:37,599
Look at me.

1254
02:01:40,143 --> 02:01:44,397
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
02:01:44,564 --> 02:01:47,067
It's how you are not.

1256
02:01:51,988 --> 02:01:53,490
Harry?

1257
02:02:25,898 --> 02:02:27,358
You're the weak one...

1258
02:02:27,983 --> 02:02:32,113
...and you'll never know love or friendship.

1259
02:02:35,533 --> 02:02:38,411
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
02:03:01,475 --> 02:03:04,937
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
02:03:05,896 --> 02:03:11,027
And you will lose everything.

1262
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:27,626
He's back.

1263
02:04:35,361 --> 02:04:37,029
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:38,781
No, you don't.

1265
02:04:44,453 --> 02:04:45,830
It's my fault.

1266
02:04:45,996 --> 02:04:49,291
No, the fault is mine.

1267
02:04:50,292 --> 02:04:52,044
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
02:04:52,211 --> 02:04:55,297
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1269
02:04:56,090 --> 02:05:00,344
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1270
02:05:00,511 --> 02:05:05,766
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:05:08,561 --> 02:05:11,897
The prophecy said:

1272
02:05:12,523 --> 02:05:16,444
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."

1273
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:23,868
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:27,455
Yes.

1275
02:05:27,913 --> 02:05:29,457
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:05:29,665 --> 02:05:33,252
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:05:33,419 --> 02:05:35,838
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:05:36,714 --> 02:05:40,217
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:05:40,384 --> 02:05:43,304
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.

1280
02:05:44,764 --> 02:05:46,891
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:14,044
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:06:14,252 --> 02:06:18,799
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1283
02:06:18,965 --> 02:06:19,966
That's awful.

1284
02:06:20,133 --> 02:06:22,052
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:06:22,219 --> 02:06:25,681
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:06:25,847 --> 02:06:28,225
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:06:31,103 --> 02:06:34,314
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:06:41,363 --> 02:06:43,407
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

1289
02:06:43,615 --> 02:06:45,242
That's all right.

1290
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:47,577
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:06:47,786 --> 02:06:51,623
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:06:54,876 --> 02:06:58,130
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:06:59,631 --> 02:07:02,342
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:07:38,003 --> 02:07:40,922
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:07:41,089 --> 02:07:42,799
What's that?

1296
02:07:43,383 --> 02:07:46,136
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:07:46,345 --> 02:07:49,431
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:07:49,598 --> 02:07:51,099
Yeah?

1299
02:07:53,018 --> 02:07:55,354
Something worth fighting for.
