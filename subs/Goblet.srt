1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:24,408
Start

2
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,443
Bloody kids.

3
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,576
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

4
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,122
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

5
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,503
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

6
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,130
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

7
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,590
I only meant...

8
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,718
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

9
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,263
No! The boy is everything!

10
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,975
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

11
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,811
Exactly as I said.

12
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,940
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

13
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,151
First, gather our old comrades.

14
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,571
Send them a sign.

15
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,794
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

16
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,631
...is standing just outside the door.

17
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,137
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

18
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,139
Avada Kedavra!

19
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,645
Harry.

20
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,064
Harry!

21
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,151
Are you all right?

22
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,987
Hermione. Bad dream.

23
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,490
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,909
Last night.

25
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,328
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,746
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,456
Honestly, get dressed.

28
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,917
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,420
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

30
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,930
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

31
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,683
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

32
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,352
Keep up!

33
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,773
Arthur!

34
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,942
It's about time, son.

35
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,488
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

36
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:46,327
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

37
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,038
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

38
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,373
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,208
This way.

40
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,296
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

41
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,216
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

42
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,176
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

43
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,473
Yes, it's just over there.

44
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,560
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,895
We don't want to be late.

46
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:17,233
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

47
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,569
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

48
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,239
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

49
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,740
Time to go!

50
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,534
What's a Portkey?

51
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,746
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

52
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,998
...Three!

53
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,176
Let go, kids!

54
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,929
- What?!
- Let go!

55
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,569
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

56
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,114
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

57
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,039
Go on, look at that!

58
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,793
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

59
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,466
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

60
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,260
Look!

61
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,430
Come on! Keep up, girls!

62
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,730
Blimey!

63
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,774
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

64
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,317
- See you at the match.
- See you.

65
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,818
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

66
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,653
See you later, Cedric.

67
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,368
Home sweet home.

68
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,705
What?

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,006
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

70
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,508
- All to the bath.
- Look.

71
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,177
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

72
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,180
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

73
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,849
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,268
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

75
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,688
I love magic.

76
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,457
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

77
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,877
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

78
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,462
Well, put it this way:

79
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,422
If it rains...

80
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,967
...you'll be the first to know.

81
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,095
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

82
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,557
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

83
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,892
Don't boast, Draco.

84
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,186
There's no need with these people.

85
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,191
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

86
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,402
While you can.

87
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,461
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

88
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,505
Come on!

89
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,718
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

90
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,720
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

91
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,270
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

92
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,736
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

93
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,160
Who's that?

94
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,955
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,544
Krum! Krum! Krum!

96
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,508
Krum!

97
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,427
Yes!

98
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,062
Good evening!

99
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,607
As Minister for Magic...

100
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,860
...it gives me great pleasure...

101
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,240
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

102
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:40,287
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

103
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,289
Let the match...

104
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,250
...begin!

105
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,549
Krum! Krum! Krum!

106
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,059
There's no one like Krum.

107
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,852
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

108
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,064
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

109
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,150
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

110
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,694
He's an artist.

111
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,154
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

112
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,698
Viktor, I love you

113
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,491
Viktor, I do

114
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,869
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

115
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,706
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

116
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,624
Stop! Stop it!

117
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,751
It's not the Irish.

118
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,046
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

119
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,551
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

120
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,054
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

121
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,890
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

122
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,226
Go!

123
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,228
Harry!

124
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,203
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

125
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,582
Harry! Harry!

126
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,756
Morsmordre!

127
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,992
Harry!

128
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,705
- Where are you?
- Harry!

129
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,584
We've been looking for you for ages!

130
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,504
Thought we lost you, mate.

131
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,340
What is that?

132
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,512
Stupefy!

133
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,013
Stop!

134
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,391
That's my son!

135
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,103
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

136
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,563
Which of you conjured it?

137
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,898
- Crouch, you can't possi--
- Do not lie!

138
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,067
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

139
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,278
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

140
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,946
What crime?

141
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,615
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

142
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,950
What, Voldemort?

143
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,997
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

144
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,374
- His followers?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,460
Death Eaters.

146
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,214
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

147
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,049
There!

148
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,552
All of you, this way!

149
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,721
A man, Harry?

150
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,473
Who?

151
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,683
I don't know.

152
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,520
I didn't see his face.

153
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:57,002
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,674
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,052
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,012
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,557
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,728
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,398
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,405
Thank you.

161
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,242
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,411
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,331
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,542
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,628
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,588
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,550
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,679
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,726
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

170
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,562
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,483
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,654
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,291
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,749
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,923
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:35,827
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,248
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,585
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,588
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,007
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,592
What is it?

182
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,264
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:02,396
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,606
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,234
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,570
...The Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,864
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,576
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,453
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,540
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,625
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,795
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:31,425
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,637
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,808
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,905
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,082
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,190
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,193
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,196
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,804
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,430
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,474
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,818
Albus.

205
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,736
Igor.

206
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,003
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,714
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,426
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,846
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,723
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,606
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,613
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,118
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,955
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,418
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,797
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,926
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,344
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,765
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,309
To explain all this...

221
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,104
...we have the head of the Department
of international Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,440
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,582
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,544
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,173
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,010
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,525
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,818
Thank you.

229
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,202
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,622
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,547
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,592
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,720
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,641
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,519
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,271
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,192
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,006
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,467
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,554
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,807
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,144
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,106
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:43,236
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,473
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,018
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,147
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,775
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,404
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,323
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,244
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,290
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:43,171
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,007
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,427
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will--

256
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,723
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,643
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,271
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,607
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,235
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,695
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,865
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,368
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,207
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,583
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,085
Stand.

267
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,048
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:31,052
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,887
The Imperius Curse.

270
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,391
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,435
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,397
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,364
Hello.

274
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,701
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,831
Engorgio.

276
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,875
Imperio!

277
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,715
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,556
If she bites...

279
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,600
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,937
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,690
Get off!

282
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,903
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,448
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,826
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,883
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,054
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,473
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,558
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,895
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,941
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,485
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,195
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,364
Up.

294
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,286
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,831
There's the...

296
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,000
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,003
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,838
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,718
The torture curse.

300
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,888
Crucio!

301
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,405
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:17,051
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,805
No?

304
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,142
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,439
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,735
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,654
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,021
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:14,233
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,570
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,323
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,619
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,998
Neville?

314
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,625
Son?

315
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,627
You all right?

316
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,964
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,481
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,414
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,515
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,351
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,145
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,230
Yes!

323
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,359
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,571
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,906
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,618
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,746
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,707
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,333
So?

330
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,547
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,717
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:07,138
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,892
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,232
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,568
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,362
Yes!

338
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,281
Ready?

339
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,745
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,255
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,635
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,304
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,931
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,771
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,315
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,349
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,647
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,941
The champion selection.

349
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,184
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,536
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,705
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:51,260
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:05,733
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:10,071
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,574
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,911
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,288
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,737
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,449
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,039
No. No.

361
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,833
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,793
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,712
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,411
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,497
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,862
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,032
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,201
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,535
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,579
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,915
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,416
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,503
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,172
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,716
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,053
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,222
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,391
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,728
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,981
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,069
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,614
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,577
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,289
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,417
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,255
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,326
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,496
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,665
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,918
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,379
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,007
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,010
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,637
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,808
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,896
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,649
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,819
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,155
What--? Do nothing?

400
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,990
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,827
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,456
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,834
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,587
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,965
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,177
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,096
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,780
How did you do it?

409
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,869
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,373
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,917
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,002
Okay?

413
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,672
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

414
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,384
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,056
I didn't put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,310
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

417
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:39,566
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,943
It just did.

419
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,404
Okay?

420
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,956
Piss off.

421
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,432
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,393
Hello.

423
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,813
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,899
I write for the Daily Prophet.

425
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:26,196
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

426
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,574
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:32,953
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,623
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,002
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

430
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,213
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:48,010
"Me, Myself & I" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,679
So who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,602
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,657
This is cozy.

435
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,951
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,621
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,582
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,334
No.

439
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,669
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,756
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12--

441
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,424
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,552
- -About to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,014
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,767
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,269
...in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,814
Concerned?

447
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,818
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,861
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,864
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,617
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

451
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,537
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,957
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,875
No, I didn't enter.

454
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,669
Of course you didn't.

455
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,548
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,385
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:16,348
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,308
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,312
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,065
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:31,155
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

462
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,772
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

463
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,234
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

464
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,612
...and she's too easily recognized.

465
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,656
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

466
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,994
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

467
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,954
And make sure you're alone.

468
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,623
Sirius.

469
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,291
P.S.:

470
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,251
The bird bites.

471
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,013
Sirius?

472
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,823
Harry Potter, age 12...

473
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,952
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

474
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,704
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

475
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,456
...and choking back tears...

476
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,516
Sirius. How--?

477
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,185
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,313
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,940
No!

480
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,817
I had to ask.

481
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:36,780
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,366
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,035
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

484
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,413
No.

485
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,042
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,544
And what was that?

487
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,339
He wanted...

488
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,174
...me.

489
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:01,054
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,516
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,518
Yes.

492
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,228
It's just a dream.

493
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,397
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,067
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,238
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe any more.

496
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,489
What are you saying?

497
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,910
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:28,498
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:34,087
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,969
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,430
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:47,601
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,271
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

504
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,194
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,823
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,077
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

507
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,331
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,210
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,779
Amazing.

510
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,451
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,412
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,290
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

513
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,627
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,839
It's already been through enough people.

515
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,133
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,928
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,180
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,682
Go.

519
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:15,814
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,985
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

521
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,571
Is that right? Well, you--

522
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,822
What?

523
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,872
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

524
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,627
Dean was told by Parvati that...

525
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,089
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,924
Hagrid's looking for you.

527
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,511
- Well, you can tell Ronald--
- I'm not an owl!

528
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,316
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

529
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,068
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,653
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,031
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,242
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,662
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,789
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,168
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,136
Hagrid?

537
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,934
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

538
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,902
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,781
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,617
...you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,786
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,247
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,126
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,962
...exhilarated.

545
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,382
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,727
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,987
Dragons?

548
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,655
That's the first task?

549
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,116
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,412
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,998
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:43,503
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,631
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,176
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

555
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,847
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,473
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,810
No, he didn't.

558
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,396
He didn't tell me a thing.

559
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,451
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,622
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

561
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,458
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

562
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,210
Like the badge?

563
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,504
Excuse me.

564
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,135
Harry.

565
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,679
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,348
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,184
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:42,354
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

569
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,400
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,737
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,906
Are you serious?

572
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,743
And Fleur and Krum, do they--?

573
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,162
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,789
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

575
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,458
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,670
- I've asked them not to wear them, but--
- Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,255
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,424
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,678
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,680
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,099
- You think so?
- I know so.

582
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,600
Anything else?

583
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:24,270
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

584
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:30,276
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,446
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,783
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,288
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,625
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,588
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,092
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

591
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:59,139
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:03,143
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,061
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting--

594
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,148
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

595
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,319
- Is that a--? ls that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

596
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,869
Stand still! Stand still!

597
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,048
- My father will hear about this!
- ls that a threat?

598
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,176
- Professor Moody!
- ls that a threat?

599
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,178
Professor!

600
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,931
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,809
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

602
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,772
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,149
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:56,154
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,698
Away!

606
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,037
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,324
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,244
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:49,040
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,672
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

611
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,882
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,843
Now...

613
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,347
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,562
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

615
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,523
Sit.

616
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,611
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,780
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:25,451
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:27,829
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,957
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,044
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,380
...but Karkaroff"s is not.

623
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,382
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,094
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

625
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,434
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,686
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,647
I don't know.

628
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,609
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

629
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,821
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,617
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,499
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,835
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,963
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

634
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,008
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,676
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,721
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,182
Your attention, please.

638
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,018
This is a great day for all of us.

639
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:39,692
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

640
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,528
Please keep your seats at all times.

641
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,448
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

642
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:49,035
- Harry? ls that you?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,912
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

644
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,165
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of luck.

645
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,879
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to--

646
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,881
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,680
Young love.

648
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,640
How...

649
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,394
...stirring.

650
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:20,233
If everything goes unfortunately today...

651
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,194
...you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,571
You have no business here.

653
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,782
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,826
...and friends.

655
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:36,791
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,755
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:47,093
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,513
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,807
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,768
Sorry, I'll just go.

661
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,562
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,148
Champions, in a circle around me.

663
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,443
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,530
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,116
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,872
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,836
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,716
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,600
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,061
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

671
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,480
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

672
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,319
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,616
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,827
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,497
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,165
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,335
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,005
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,507
Any questions?

680
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,177
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,180
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may--

682
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:26,651
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

683
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,582
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

684
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,253
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

685
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,923
And now our fourth and final contestant.

686
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,470
Harry! Harry! Harry!

687
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,498
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,043
Accio Firebolt!

689
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,199
- Yeah!
- Yes!

690
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,542
Oh, my God.

691
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,514
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,668
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,569
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,696
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,614
- Never!
- Never!

696
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,034
Shush!

697
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,204
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

698
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,041
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

699
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:19,378
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,975
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,857
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:44,069
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,243
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,288
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,541
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,960
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,424
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,762
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,388
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,600
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,812
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,942
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:26,946
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,156
...after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,201
Who--? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,286
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,498
Yeah. isn't it?

718
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,708
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,004
Boys.

720
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,905
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,161
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

722
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,792
Shush.

723
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,836
Look at this!

724
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,340
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

725
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,635
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl..."

726
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,555
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:37,016
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,811
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:45,024
"No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

730
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,360
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,029
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,661
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,040
Go on.

734
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,131
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

735
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,093
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

736
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,062
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:27,066
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,360
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,864
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

740
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,409
What are you on about?

741
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,536
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,080
They're for you.

743
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:45,834
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,254
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:54,760
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,554
...since its inception.

747
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:02,101
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,936
...gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:08,148
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,944
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:17,241
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,160
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:24,790
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,126
...a dance.

755
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,173
Silence!

756
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,385
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,179
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:43,434
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,813
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,482
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,151
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,029
...is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,533
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,077
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:06,248
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

766
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,543
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,962
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

768
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,548
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:22,681
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,434
- Where?
- My waist.

771
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,187
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,564
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,652
One, two, three.

774
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,323
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,162
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,497
- Never.
- Never.

777
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,542
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,567
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,403
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:29,748
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

781
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,167
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,925
I take after my mum.

783
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:44,054
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,139
No, not the maternal sort, apparently.

785
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,893
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:54,606
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,109
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,029
Very funny.

789
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,706
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

790
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,917
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,587
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:38,859
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,864
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:46,700
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,787
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

796
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,000
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,343
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

798
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,347
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:12,768
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

800
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:18,231
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,317
To the ball?

802
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:21,944
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,199
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,034
You're a girl.

805
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,535
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,621
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,170
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,838
For a girl, it's just sad.

809
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:45,759
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,726
And I said yes!

811
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,146
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,982
She's lying, right?

813
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,400
If you say so.

814
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,404
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,449
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,201
Agreed.

817
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,893
- Cho!
- Harry!

818
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,191
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,943
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,449
Cho?

821
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,951
Yes?

822
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,580
Well, I just wondered if you--

823
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:59,416
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,462
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,301
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:16,892
Harry...

827
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,895
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,314
And...

829
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:26,234
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

830
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,489
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:34,493
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,411
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,414
Harry?

834
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,833
I really am...

835
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,668
...sorry.

836
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,930
It's all right, Ron.

837
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:58,308
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

838
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,352
What happened to you?

839
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,771
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,440
- What?
- What did she say?

841
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:06,983
No, of course.

842
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,863
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

843
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:16,701
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,081
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:24,709
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,506
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:33,385
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

848
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,803
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:38,056
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,935
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:43,562
Hey!

852
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:06,376
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,173
Bloody...

854
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,591
Oh, bloody...

855
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,972
What are those? What are those?

856
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,184
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

857
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,270
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

858
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,397
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

859
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:32,611
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

860
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,033
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

861
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,623
Murder me, Harry.

862
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,584
Leave it alone!

863
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,963
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

864
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,633
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

865
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,386
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

866
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,764
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

867
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:06,019
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

868
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,396
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

869
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,398
Don't you look...

870
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,150
...dashing.

871
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,904
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

872
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,906
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

873
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,117
It's traditional that the three champions--
Well, in this case, four.

874
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,327
--Are the first to dance.

875
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,330
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

876
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,624
Well, now you know.

877
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:33,421
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

878
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,007
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

879
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,676
Come along this way.

880
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,349
Oh, come on.

881
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,185
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

882
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,730
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

883
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,360
This way. This way. Come along.

884
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,281
She looks beautiful!

885
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,032
Yeah, she does.

886
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:52,000
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

887
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,211
No. Absolutely not.

888
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,468
Hi!

889
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,228
Harry, take my waist.

890
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,522
- What?
- Now!

891
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,966
Are you ready?

892
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,802
Move your body like a hairy troll

893
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:29,013
Learning to rock and roll

894
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,016
Spin around like a crazy elf

895
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,769
Dancing by himself

896
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:38,398
Boogie down like a unicorn

897
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:41,025
No stopping till the break of dawn

898
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:44,028
Put your hands up in the air

899
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,990
Like an ogre who just don't care

900
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,368
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

901
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,873
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

902
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,462
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

903
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:03,923
May I have your arm?

904
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,843
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

905
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,329
Hot, isn't it?

906
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:38,333
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

907
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:42,212
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

908
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:46,216
What's got your wand in a knot?

909
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:50,220
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

910
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,932
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

911
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,101
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

912
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,772
...is international
magical cooperation...

913
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,941
...to make friends.

914
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,778
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

915
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,082
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

916
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,667
No.

917
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,344
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

918
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:35,723
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

919
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,561
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

920
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,854
You know the solution then, don't you?

921
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,023
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

922
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,318
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

923
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,529
And not as a last resort.

924
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:53,908
Well, that's-- I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

925
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,410
Harry.

926
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,161
Where have you been?

927
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,831
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

928
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:06,671
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

929
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,715
What's this about?

930
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:16,014
No, don't let

931
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:22,145
This magic die

932
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,691
The answer's there

933
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,085
Let me see it again.

934
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,339
Yes, the time is close now.

935
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,887
Harry, at last!

936
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:44,519
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

937
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,531
You all right, Harry?

938
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,742
I just got in.

939
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,577
Me.

940
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,134
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

941
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:20,471
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

942
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,808
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

943
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,811
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

944
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:32,650
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

945
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:39,574
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

946
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,285
Mostly, he watches me study.

947
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,163
It's a bit annoying, actually.

948
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,250
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

949
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,627
What's that supposed to mean?

950
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:55,173
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

951
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,509
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

952
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,304
And...

953
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,516
...I'm scared for you.

954
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:09,061
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

955
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,190
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

956
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,025
Hey, Potter!

957
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,282
- Potter!
- Cedric.

958
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,661
How--? How are you?

959
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,122
Spectacular.

960
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,503
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

961
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,005
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

962
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:37,882
Exactly.

963
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,552
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

964
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,975
It's not a bad place for a bath.

965
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,230
Just take your egg...

966
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,733
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

967
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,104
I must be out of my mind.

968
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:45,449
I'm definitely out of my mind.

969
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,414
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

970
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:53,457
Myrtle!

971
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,376
Hello, Harry.

972
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:59,380
Long time no see.

973
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:07,305
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

974
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,933
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

975
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:13,436
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

976
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,354
Polyjuice Potion?

977
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:20,151
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

978
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,659
That's what he did.

979
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,162
The other boy...

980
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,665
...the handsome one...

981
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,168
...Cedric.

982
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:43,257
Well, go on. Open it.

983
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:56,354
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

984
01:27:56,521 --> 01:28:01,192
We cannot sing
Above the ground

985
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,738
An hour long you'll have to look

986
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:11,160
To recover what we took

987
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,544
Myrtle...

988
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:25,675
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

989
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,219
Very good.

990
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:33,474
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

991
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:37,728
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

992
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,415
Harry, tell me again.

993
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,919
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

994
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,672
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

995
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:08,175
"An hour long you'll have to look."

996
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,804
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

997
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,057
"Potentially problematic"?

998
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:18,477
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

999
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:23,357
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1000
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,027
Hate to break up the skull session.

1001
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,195
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1002
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,823
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1003
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,659
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and--

1004
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,454
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1005
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,456
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1006
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,125
Go. Now!

1007
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,928
Longbottom!

1008
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,139
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1009
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:05,983
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1010
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,736
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1011
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:13,657
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1012
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:17,578
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1013
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,914
...about plants.

1014
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,957
Now, if there's...

1015
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:26,921
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1016
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,590
...then great. But otherwise--

1017
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:33,552
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1018
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,640
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1019
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:39,266
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1020
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,851
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1021
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,187
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1022
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:44,897
Don't be so mean.

1023
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,358
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1024
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,529
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1025
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,614
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1026
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,282
Most likely?

1027
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,660
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1028
01:30:57,828 --> 01:31:00,287
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water--

1029
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,124
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1030
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,251
I just wanted to help.

1031
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:08,546
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1032
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,464
Where are they anyway?

1033
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:13,676
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1034
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,893
Welcome to the second task.

1035
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:26,772
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1036
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,315
A treasure of sorts.

1037
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,110
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1038
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:33,988
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1039
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:35,739
In order to win...

1040
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,743
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1041
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,538
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1042
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:46,333
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1043
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,421
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1044
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,174
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1045
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:22,620
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1046
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,957
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1047
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,711
Yeah!

1048
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,505
What?

1049
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,212
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1050
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,923
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1051
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:01,677
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1052
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,298
But she's my friend too!

1053
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,635
Only one!

1054
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,855
Let's get down below.

1055
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,701
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1056
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:29,927
Yes!

1057
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:50,113
Ascendio!

1058
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,079
Harry!

1059
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:00,832
He's all right.

1060
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:03,460
He's all right. Barty!

1061
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:07,089
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1062
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:11,176
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1063
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:13,512
My little sister.

1064
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,472
Thank you.

1065
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,017
And you! You helped.

1066
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,688
Well, yeah, a bit.

1067
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,071
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1068
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,907
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1069
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,077
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1070
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,288
I finished last, Hermione.

1071
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:44,251
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1072
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:47,671
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1073
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:50,716
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1074
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,679
Attention!

1075
01:38:56,139 --> 01:39:00,017
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1076
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:03,937
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1077
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,773
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1078
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:11,903
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1079
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:16,366
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1080
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,535
...second place...

1081
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,203
- Second place!
- Well done!

1082
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,998
...For outstanding moral fiber!

1083
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,792
Yes!

1084
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:31,089
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1085
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:32,883
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1086
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:35,427
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1087
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:38,263
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1088
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,098
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1089
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,808
Well done, boy.

1090
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:45,228
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1091
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:49,399
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1092
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,862
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1093
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,031
...to lose one's family.

1094
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,202
Never whole again, are we?

1095
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:04,539
Still, life goes on...

1096
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,875
...and here we stand.

1097
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:12,464
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1098
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:14,091
Bartemius!

1099
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:18,428
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1100
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:21,765
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1101
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,154
And they say I'm mad.

1102
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:49,167
Now, I remember--
I remember when I first met you all.

1103
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:52,379
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1104
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,465
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1105
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:59,636
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1106
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:03,140
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1107
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,891
And Harry, of course.

1108
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:10,439
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1109
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,649
Hooray!

1110
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,611
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1111
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,406
Teach us something, please

1112
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,876
Mr. Crouch?

1113
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:41,553
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1114
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,305
I will not.

1115
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:47,517
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1116
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:49,019
Then for once show them some!

1117
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:53,315
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1118
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:56,693
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1119
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,654
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1120
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:03,492
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1121
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,372
Oh, Harry!

1122
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,875
Harry, how good to see you again.

1123
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,211
I can come back later, professor.

1124
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,714
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1125
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,467
Minister, after you.

1126
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,011
There you are. Your hat.

1127
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:26,848
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1128
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:30,227
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1129
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,278
Professor?

1130
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,989
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1131
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:20,670
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1132
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:22,756
...to present evidence to this council.

1133
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,634
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1134
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:29,846
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1135
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:34,643
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1136
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,519
Do you accept these terms?

1137
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:39,773
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1138
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,567
I have names, sir.

1139
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:46,696
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1140
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:51,910
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1141
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:54,204
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1142
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:57,040
- If that is all the witness has to offer--
- No, no, no.

1143
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:00,502
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1144
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,046
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1145
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:04,339
Yeah, the same.

1146
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:08,218
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1147
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:12,722
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1148
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:14,891
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1149
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:19,771
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1150
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:22,899
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1151
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:27,070
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1152
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,240
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1153
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:33,827
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1154
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:36,287
Silence!

1155
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:40,333
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1156
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,627
...this session is now concluded.

1157
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:44,921
Oh, no, no, no.

1158
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,257
I've heard about one more.

1159
01:45:47,425 --> 01:45:50,010
- What's that?
- The name.

1160
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:51,636
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1161
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,847
...this person took part
in the capture...

1162
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:56,182
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1163
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:59,853
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1164
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,355
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1165
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:05,066
Barty Crouch...

1166
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:08,778
...Junior.

1167
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:19,956
Hold him down!

1168
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:27,255
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1169
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:30,550
Hello, Father.

1170
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:34,012
You are no son of mine.

1171
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:49,819
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1172
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:52,572
It's a Pensieve.

1173
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,410
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1174
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:01,122
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1175
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:04,542
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1176
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,294
...some small detail...

1177
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,839
...something I might have overlooked...

1178
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:14,177
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1179
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:18,848
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1180
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,518
It's maddening.

1181
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,647
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1182
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:28,483
What exactly happened to him?

1183
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:33,446
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1184
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:37,700
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1185
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:42,205
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1186
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:45,041
I had a dream about him.

1187
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:50,088
It was in the summer, before school.

1188
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:55,218
In the dream, I was in a house.

1189
01:47:55,427 --> 01:48:00,223
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1190
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:04,018
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1191
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:07,230
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1192
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,691
Always the same one.

1193
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,071
Sir, these dreams...

1194
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:20,410
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1195
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:25,039
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1196
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:27,500
I think it's best if you simply...

1197
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:34,924
...cast them away.

1198
01:48:44,185 --> 01:48:48,146
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1199
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,072
Potter!

1200
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,783
What's your hurry?

1201
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:09,626
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1202
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:12,086
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1203
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:14,380
Yes, sir.

1204
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:16,716
Ingenious.

1205
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:22,513
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1206
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,809
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1207
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,480
Nor is this.

1208
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:36,319
Know what it is?

1209
01:49:37,655 --> 01:49:39,072
Bubble juice, sir?

1210
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:41,532
Veritaserum.

1211
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:45,995
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1212
01:49:46,163 --> 01:49:51,334
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1213
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:55,004
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1214
01:49:55,172 --> 01:50:00,051
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1215
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:04,639
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1216
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:11,479
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1217
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:15,525
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1218
01:50:15,693 --> 01:50:17,860
...I'm going to find out why!

1219
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,306
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1220
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,035
Sonorus!

1221
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:16,586
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1222
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:21,758
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1223
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:25,636
...and Mr. Potter...

1224
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:29,265
...are tied for first position...

1225
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:33,561
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1226
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:38,274
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1227
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:42,236
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1228
01:51:46,575 --> 01:51:49,285
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1229
01:51:49,453 --> 01:51:52,413
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1230
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:57,085
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1231
01:51:57,419 --> 01:52:01,297
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1232
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:08,805
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1233
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,308
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1234
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:15,520
You see, people change in the maze.

1235
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:17,397
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1236
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:22,318
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1237
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,823
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1238
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,333
Good luck.

1239
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,669
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1240
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:44,632
On the count of three. One--

1241
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:13,633
Fleur?

1242
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:16,719
Fleur.

1243
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,141
Periculum!

1244
01:57:00,806 --> 01:57:04,600
Get down!

1245
01:57:05,227 --> 01:57:06,435
Expelliarmus!

1246
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:19,281
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1247
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:21,492
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1248
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:34,797
Yes.

1249
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:57,294
Harry!

1250
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:13,043
Reducto!

1251
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:32,354
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1252
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:37,443
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1253
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:39,361
For a moment, so did I.

1254
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:42,364
Some game, huh?

1255
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:44,825
Some game.

1256
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:51,874
Go!

1257
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:05,054
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1258
01:59:05,222 --> 01:59:07,223
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1259
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,641
...three!
- ...three!

1260
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:24,031
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1261
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:32,414
Where are we?

1262
01:59:38,129 --> 01:59:39,755
I've been here before.

1263
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:45,010
It's a Portkey.

1264
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:51,058
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1265
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:56,522
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1266
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:58,649
What are you talking about?

1267
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:06,782
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1268
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,792
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1269
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,712
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1270
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:32,892
Do it! Now!

1271
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:47,323
Bone of the father...

1272
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,825
...unwillingly given.

1273
02:00:57,292 --> 02:01:00,336
Flesh of the servant...

1274
02:01:02,339 --> 02:01:05,507
...willingly sacrificed.

1275
02:01:09,638 --> 02:01:13,349
And blood of the enemy...

1276
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:21,690
...forcibly taken.

1277
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:30,699
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1278
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,369
...again.

1279
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:40,185
My wand, Wormtail.

1280
02:02:49,738 --> 02:02:51,697
Hold out your arm.

1281
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:53,449
Master.

1282
02:02:53,616 --> 02:02:56,285
Thank you, master.

1283
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:57,911
The other arm, Wormtail.

1284
02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:40,454
Welcome, my friends.

1285
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:44,625
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1286
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:50,756
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1287
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:54,635
I confess myself...

1288
02:03:55,095 --> 02:03:56,678
...disappointed.

1289
02:03:57,347 --> 02:03:59,431
Not one of you tried to find me.

1290
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:02,976
Crabbe! Macnair!

1291
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,187
Goyle!

1292
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:09,358
Not even you...

1293
02:04:13,196 --> 02:04:15,155
...Lucius.

1294
02:04:16,991 --> 02:04:21,829
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts--

1295
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,998
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1296
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:30,337
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1297
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:37,678
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1298
02:04:39,681 --> 02:04:42,307
...that is my true mask.

1299
02:04:42,684 --> 02:04:44,226
I returned.

1300
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:50,607
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1301
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:57,531
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1302
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:05,080
Thank you, master.

1303
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,416
Thank you.

1304
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:12,880
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1305
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:15,841
Harry.

1306
02:05:16,009 --> 02:05:18,802
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1307
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:23,390
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1308
02:05:23,558 --> 02:05:24,933
I'd introduce you...

1309
02:05:25,101 --> 02:05:29,396
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1310
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:34,735
The boy who lived.

1311
02:05:34,903 --> 02:05:37,779
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1312
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:41,950
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1313
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:46,872
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1314
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,624
Yes, shall I?

1315
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:50,292
It was love.

1316
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:54,963
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1317
02:05:55,131 --> 02:05:57,758
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1318
02:05:58,134 --> 02:05:59,968
I could not touch him.

1319
02:06:01,179 --> 02:06:03,305
It was old magic.

1320
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,766
Something I should have foreseen.

1321
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:07,726
But no matter, no matter.

1322
02:06:07,894 --> 02:06:10,103
Things have changed.

1323
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:14,358
I can touch you...

1324
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:16,693
...now.

1325
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:26,161
Yeah.

1326
02:06:32,502 --> 02:06:36,213
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1327
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,091
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1328
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:42,928
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1329
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:46,848
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1330
02:06:47,016 --> 02:06:49,434
First, we bow to each other.

1331
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:51,979
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1332
02:06:52,146 --> 02:06:55,357
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1333
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:56,858
I said, bow.

1334
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:03,073
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1335
02:07:03,491 --> 02:07:05,091
Crucio!

1336
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:12,541
Attaboy, Harry.

1337
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:14,876
Your parents would be proud.

1338
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:18,547
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1339
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:20,340
Expelliar--

1340
02:07:23,344 --> 02:07:25,721
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1341
02:07:25,888 --> 02:07:27,889
I'm going to destroy you.

1342
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:35,689
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1343
02:07:36,316 --> 02:07:38,900
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1344
02:07:39,068 --> 02:07:41,737
...they'll speak only of how you...

1345
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:43,864
...begged for death.

1346
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:47,784
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1347
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:49,911
...obliged.

1348
02:07:50,246 --> 02:07:51,747
Get up!

1349
02:07:56,753 --> 02:07:58,754
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1350
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:01,173
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1351
02:08:01,341 --> 02:08:04,551
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1352
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:20,233
Have it your way.

1353
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:23,653
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1354
02:08:41,172 --> 02:08:43,840
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1355
02:08:48,429 --> 02:08:50,138
He's mine!

1356
02:09:23,172 --> 02:09:27,175
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1357
02:09:27,343 --> 02:09:29,428
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1358
02:09:29,595 --> 02:09:31,346
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1359
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:35,600
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1360
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:38,311
Take my body back to my father.

1361
02:09:39,355 --> 02:09:40,689
Let go.

1362
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:43,108
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1363
02:09:43,943 --> 02:09:46,570
Let go! Let go!

1364
02:09:52,326 --> 02:09:53,702
Accio!

1365
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:01,376
No!

1366
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:15,724
He did it!

1367
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:18,576
Harry!

1368
02:10:24,108 --> 02:10:27,360
No! No! No, don't!

1369
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:29,529
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1370
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:32,407
He's back. He's back.

1371
02:10:32,575 --> 02:10:34,576
Voldemort's back.

1372
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:37,162
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1373
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:39,664
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1374
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:42,626
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1375
02:10:42,793 --> 02:10:45,086
He's home. You both are.

1376
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:48,924
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1377
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:55,639
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1378
02:10:55,932 --> 02:10:57,599
Let me through.

1379
02:10:57,767 --> 02:11:02,479
Let me through!

1380
02:11:02,647 --> 02:11:04,064
That's my son!

1381
02:11:05,358 --> 02:11:06,775
That's my boy!

1382
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:12,364
It's my boy!

1383
02:11:15,159 --> 02:11:18,745
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1384
02:11:18,913 --> 02:11:21,873
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1385
02:11:22,542 --> 02:11:24,751
No!

1386
02:11:27,797 --> 02:11:30,215
It's all right, I got you.

1387
02:11:30,383 --> 02:11:33,718
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1388
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:42,477
No!

1389
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,605
Are you all right, Potter?

1390
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:29,107
Does it hurt? That?

1391
02:12:29,275 --> 02:12:31,067
Not so much now.

1392
02:12:32,028 --> 02:12:34,112
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1393
02:12:37,241 --> 02:12:39,242
The cup was a Portkey.

1394
02:12:41,954 --> 02:12:43,788
Someone had bewitched it.

1395
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:46,166
What was it like?

1396
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,168
- What was he like?
- Who?

1397
02:12:48,336 --> 02:12:50,086
The Dark Lord.

1398
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:55,508
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1399
02:12:56,761 --> 02:12:58,553
I don't know.

1400
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:04,351
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1401
02:13:07,313 --> 02:13:09,314
...into one of my nightmares.

1402
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:29,584
Were there others?

1403
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:32,045
In the graveyard, were there others?

1404
02:13:35,966 --> 02:13:37,384
I...

1405
02:13:38,094 --> 02:13:42,013
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1406
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:52,732
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1407
02:13:57,113 --> 02:14:00,198
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1408
02:14:00,366 --> 02:14:02,283
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1409
02:14:05,788 --> 02:14:09,499
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1410
02:14:09,667 --> 02:14:12,168
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1411
02:14:13,796 --> 02:14:16,464
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1412
02:14:16,632 --> 02:14:19,801
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1413
02:14:19,969 --> 02:14:21,553
...that led him straight to it?

1414
02:14:29,979 --> 02:14:33,982
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1415
02:14:34,525 --> 02:14:38,153
- You bewitched Krum, but you--
- "But-- But--"

1416
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,488
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1417
02:14:41,157 --> 02:14:44,659
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1418
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:46,119
And now the deed is done.

1419
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:52,125
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1420
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:04,137
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1421
02:15:05,055 --> 02:15:07,557
...that I have once and for all...

1422
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:12,520
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1423
02:15:12,688 --> 02:15:13,938
Expelliarmus!

1424
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:19,903
Severus.

1425
02:15:22,364 --> 02:15:23,865
That's it, take it.

1426
02:15:25,868 --> 02:15:29,329
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1427
02:15:29,497 --> 02:15:32,207
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1428
02:15:32,374 --> 02:15:35,460
Is he in this room? ls he in this room?

1429
02:15:38,506 --> 02:15:40,048
Harry, away from there!

1430
02:16:01,028 --> 02:16:04,364
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1431
02:16:05,324 --> 02:16:07,408
That's Moody. But then who's--?

1432
02:16:09,203 --> 02:16:10,286
Polyjuice Potion.

1433
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:13,706
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1434
02:16:13,916 --> 02:16:15,875
We'll get you up in a minute.

1435
02:16:50,286 --> 02:16:51,703
Harry!

1436
02:16:55,374 --> 02:16:57,584
Barty Crouch Junior.

1437
02:16:57,793 --> 02:17:00,753
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1438
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:04,299
Your arm, Harry.

1439
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:10,930
You know what this means, don't you?

1440
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:13,141
He's back.

1441
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:16,477
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1442
02:17:17,438 --> 02:17:19,772
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1443
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:24,485
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1444
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:27,488
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1445
02:17:28,032 --> 02:17:30,909
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1446
02:17:50,804 --> 02:17:53,473
Today, we acknowledge...

1447
02:17:54,183 --> 02:17:56,935
...a really terrible loss.

1448
02:17:59,021 --> 02:18:01,814
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1449
02:18:01,982 --> 02:18:04,317
...exceptionally hard-working...

1450
02:18:05,194 --> 02:18:07,570
...infinitely fair-minded...

1451
02:18:08,155 --> 02:18:10,448
...and, most importantly...

1452
02:18:10,741 --> 02:18:15,328
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1453
02:18:16,455 --> 02:18:20,833
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1454
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:25,380
You see...

1455
02:18:26,215 --> 02:18:28,341
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1456
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:31,219
...by Lord Voldemort!

1457
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:36,724
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1458
02:18:37,351 --> 02:18:41,062
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1459
02:18:43,232 --> 02:18:44,899
Now, the pain...

1460
02:18:45,067 --> 02:18:48,736
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1461
02:18:48,904 --> 02:18:50,238
...and reminds us...

1462
02:18:50,406 --> 02:18:54,075
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1463
02:18:54,243 --> 02:18:57,704
...our hearts beat as one.

1464
02:18:58,205 --> 02:19:00,248
In light of recent events...

1465
02:19:00,582 --> 02:19:05,503
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1466
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:11,718
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1467
02:19:12,136 --> 02:19:14,262
You remember that...

1468
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,932
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1469
02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:20,935
...kind and honest...

1470
02:19:21,437 --> 02:19:26,024
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1471
02:19:51,258 --> 02:19:53,301
I never liked these curtains.

1472
02:19:53,886 --> 02:19:56,554
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1473
02:19:56,889 --> 02:19:58,723
By accident, of course.

1474
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:08,775
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1475
02:20:12,154 --> 02:20:13,863
Professor...

1476
02:20:14,073 --> 02:20:17,075
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1477
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:22,288
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1478
02:20:23,832 --> 02:20:26,167
Priori Incantatem.

1479
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:33,049
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1480
02:20:33,634 --> 02:20:35,468
They reappeared.

1481
02:20:36,929 --> 02:20:40,681
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1482
02:20:43,268 --> 02:20:45,853
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1483
02:20:46,355 --> 02:20:51,192
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1484
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:56,197
But remember this:

1485
02:20:56,365 --> 02:20:58,324
You have friends here.

1486
02:21:00,327 --> 02:21:02,078
You're not alone.

1487
02:21:22,766 --> 02:21:24,517
Hermione.

1488
02:21:24,893 --> 02:21:26,894
This is for you.

1489
02:21:27,521 --> 02:21:29,730
Write to me. Promise.

1490
02:21:30,816 --> 02:21:32,233
Bye.

1491
02:21:38,448 --> 02:21:40,408
Au revoir, Ron.

1492
02:22:24,328 --> 02:22:26,871
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1493
02:22:27,039 --> 02:22:28,164
- No.
- No.

1494
02:22:28,332 --> 02:22:32,710
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1495
02:22:37,132 --> 02:22:39,967
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1496
02:22:47,267 --> 02:22:48,726
Yes.

1497
02:22:53,482 --> 02:22:56,776
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1498
02:22:56,944 --> 02:22:59,487
I won't. You know I won't.

1499
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:04,533
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
